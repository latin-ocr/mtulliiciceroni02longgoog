mense; ond all hod been won by the sword. From the earliest period
of her history, so far ss we know it, Rome wns olwsys st war, sometimes
fighting for her existence, but always extending ber dominion. She
believed it to be her destiny to conquer the world, end she accomplished
it. 'Phe conquest of Itsly was the work of centuries3 ond the means
for the subjugetion of the peninsula were derived from Italy herself.
'l'he acquisition of foreign countries supplied Rome with fresh means,
and the conquest of one country gave her the power of adding another
to her subject states. The weelth of the provinces enriched both the
Romen state ond the Roman citizen. But the civil wars of the last
century exhausted even these great resouroes, end when tho &man
Republio became a Monarchy under the Caesare, both the general
administration ond the management of the public revenue underwent
many changes. At present we heve only to consider the Republicsn
period.

The division of things into public end private (Publice, Privata) was
en old, original distinction et Rome, which in fact must exist in every
state. Thone things ere Public or moy be called Public property, which
are set oport for public use, as roods, rivers, end buildings for public
purposes. The public property of the Roman stete in its infsncy could
not be much ; but it was increased by conquest. It was s Roman prin-

quered people lost all thot they hed. If ony thing wss left to them, .
they owed it to the mercy and generosity of the conqueror. The con·
quered people were sometimes killed or they were mode slsves (Livy
vii. 19; mi. 27). Their moveable property was booty (proedo), ondit
wne carried off. Their land became the property of the Roman state.
This land which was tehen from the enemy wss Ager Publicus; und

land so tehen and mede Publicus was eeid ‘Publicnri’ (Dig. 49. 15. 20. Α ¹

ᾗ 1). Even the terme of s formul surrender to the Romen people,e
Deditio, os it wsOnamed, comprehended s complete abandonment of all

that the people had, as we see by the formula of Deditio in Livy (i. 38).
It comprehended city, lende, water, boundorics‚ temples, utensile, every

thing thot was appropriated to the purposes of religion end the use of
man. But the Deditio saved o city from the fury of the soldiers end
from being socked (Livy xxxvii. 32).

Rome was s town with o small territory3 ond the Italion peoples
who ore comprehended under one name, os Latini, Volsci, Hernici, end
others, were o confederecy of such towns. Eoch town hodite territory,

consisting of ereble lond, which was private property, ond of public land,
