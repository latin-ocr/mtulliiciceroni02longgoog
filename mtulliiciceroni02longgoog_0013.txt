2 INTRODUOTION.

ashed Naevius to come to a settlement about their silaus, sines he
supposed that there was some matter in dispute between them. All
attempta at a friendly settlement failed, as Cicero says3 but at last
Naevius declared (c. (t) that there was nothing due to him on the part-
nership account (o. 6: ‘ait' se auctionatum‚' ec.); and that if Quintius
had any demand against him, he was ready to answer it. They parted
without requiring of each other the usual security for appear-ing in
court on a given day. Naevius stayed at Bome; Quintius went into
Gallia to look after his affairs. Aa soon as Naevius heard that Quintius
- had got as far aa the Vada Volaterrana on his journey, be summoned his
fnends to the Tabula Sextia to hear witness that Quintius had not made
his appearance there, and that he had3 though, as cicero says, Quintius
was not bound to appear, nor Naevius either. Upon this iailure oi
Quintius, οι· alleged failure, to appear, Naevius applied to the Praetor
Burrienus to obtain execution, or, in the Roman phrase, to take pos·
session of the property of his debtor3 for this application to the Praetor
implied a demand of Naevius against P. Quintius of some definite
amount of money (c. 6). Naevius obtained the Praetor’s order3 and
we must assume that ho produced the necessary evidence to obtain it.
He then put up notices (libelli) of the sale of the property of P. Quin·
tius, which Alfenus, the procurator of P. Quintius, pulled down, and
gave Naevius notice that he would stand in the place of Quintius and
defend him. In the mean time, it ia said by Cicero, P. Quintius was
ejected from the pastore-grounds and common property which Naevius
and Quintius bad in Gallia: he was ejected by the slaves which they
held in common. But we do not know what this common or partner-
ship property was. It might be either the partnership property oi Ο.
Quintius and Naevius, which was still undivided‚ or it might be partner-
ship property of P. Quintius and Naevius, who had formed a new purt-
nership after the original partnership was dissolved by the death oi
Ο. Quintius. There is no statement that the two men had come to a
settlemeut after the death oi C. Quintius, and it seems that they con·
tinued to osny on the business as before with the old·partnership
property, and thus by their acts without any formul agreement they
made a new partnership3 for the acts of the parties could establish a
partnership without any other evidence of consent, as people may do in
Englund (Gaius, iii. ᾖ, 135). And Cicero tells us in plain words (c. 29)
that Naevius and P. Quintius, at the time when he was speaking, held
as partnership property the ‘saltus’ or pastina-grounds from which P.
Quintius was expelled. Now Cicero could not use the expression “ per
vim expulso socio,” unless Naevius and P. Quintius were in partnership;
lor the death of (l. Quintius had dissolved the old partnership.
Farther, he says that P. Quintius had some slaves of his own on tho
