INTRODUCTION. 291

would render it probable that bc would use any means to deprive Op-
pianicus of his life aster having by averdict deprived him of his character.
Cicero found it very difficult to deal with this unfavourable opinion
about Cluentius, as in fact it is always more difficult to convince people
of the falsebood of vague reports and rumours against a man’s character
than to answer 1 specific charge, 11 1111 of poisoning. For the specific
charge is reduced to one fact or more, it is expressed in writing, and if
it is not proved, the evidence will show whether the charge is altogether
unfounded, or is still probably true, though not capable of atrict proof.

Cluentius was tried under the Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis
(156). The real matter, the charge of poisoning,is not examined 1]
Cicero till we come to near the end of the oration (c. 60).

This is the substance of the matter which Klotz has stated inhia
Introduction to this oration. Ibave used for the text of this oration
Classen’s edition and Baiter’s in the second editiones Orelli's Cicero.

Nearly all Clsssen’s notes are on the various readings aud the text.
His edition (81111881) is a model ofjudgmeut and good sense; and
I have very seldom seen 11] reason for rejecting his opinion. His notes
written in Latin are short, and well written. Baiter generally follows
Classen. The following are the abbreviatione used by Baiter in his'
various readings at the foot of the page. ‘⁶ P: Palimpsestus laurinensis
apud Peyronum; S = Codex olim Salisburgi, nunc in bibliotheca regia

Monacensi sub no. 35· servatus, seculo fere decimo quinto elegantissima

likeness between S and Τ will easily be discovered by a comparison of
the readings. “F = Codex olim bibliothecae S. Bartholomaei Faesulis
