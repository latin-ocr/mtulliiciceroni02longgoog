INTRODUGTION. 187

Sponsio was made, which was the formal way of trying the truth of tha
defendant‘s answer (see Vol. Ι. Excursus V.). The Praetor appointed¹
three J udices, who are named Recuperatores, to try the casa (c. 8).

Cicero supported the case of Caecina before the Recuperatores against
Aebutius and L. Piso who conducted the case for Aebutius. It appears
that there had been two hearings of the case, aad that the Recupera-
tores had not been able to come to a decision (a. 2). The acts of
violence were not denied by Aebutius ; and Cicero says in the beginning
of his speech( . 1) that as the facts are admitted, he is well content on
that head. But the advocate of Aebutius maintained that he was jus-
tified in using these acts of violence, and thus the case before the
Recuperatorcs was made by Aebutius a question of law (de jure civili,
c. 2).

The essay of Sarigny on Possession (Das Recht des Besitzes) contains
explanations of several of the passages in this oration. The following
is his brief statement of tha matter which was before the court (p. 462,
5th ed.): “'l'he case in which Cicero appeared as the advocate of the
plaintiff is briefly thisz Caecina maintains that he has got a piece of
land by testamentary bequest; Aebutius claime the ownership on other
grounds: Caecina attempta to go upon the land, but is forcibly kept
bach by Aebutius and a number of armed men. It is most probable
that Caecina had not yet been in possession, Cicero certainly says that
he had possessed, bnt this affirmation which would have been decisivo,
eomes quite at the end of the speech, und is expressed only in a couple
of words (c. 31, 82), and as if it were superfluous ; so that it was mani·
festly his object to put it in the shsde; arrd yet in these few words we

find more than one trace‚from which exactly the opposite of that affirma· Ι

tion can be deduced (particularly the words, ‘Caesenniam possedisse
propter usumfructum negas,’ Aac), If Caecina iu fact had never had
the possession, he could only gain his cause hythe J udices being of
opinion that Possession was not necessary for this Interdict. Accord-
ingly it was the object of his advocate to make this false proposition as
probable as possible, which Cicero has donc, and consequently he cannot
be quoted as historicsl authority.”

The latest andmost complete examinationof the case of Caecina is by
Keller (Semestrium, &aba and in order to understand it, we must
follow him through the different beods which he discusses, notwithstand-
ing there may be a repetition of a few things which have been said in
the notes on tbe Pro Trallis.

lf a nran lost the possession of a piece ef ground through force, the
form in which ha claimed to be restored depended on the fact whether
he was ejected by force of arms or by force without the use of arms.
