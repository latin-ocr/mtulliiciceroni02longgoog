CAP. 33, 34. 457

id quod egomet vidi, quum venissem Capuam coloniam deductam
L. Considio et Sext. Saltio, quemadmodum ipsi loquebantur, prae·
toribus, ut intelligatis quantam locus ipse alferat superbiam, quae
paucis diebus quibus illo colonia deducta est perspici atque intelligi
potuit. Namprimnm, id quod dixi, quum ceteris in coloniis duum-
viri appellentur, hi se praetores appellari volebant. Quibus primus
annus hanc cupiditatem attulisset, nonna arbitremini paucis annis
fuisse consulum nomen appetituros! Deinde anteibant lictores,
non cum baculis, aed, ut hic praetoribus antecnnt, cum fascibus
duobus. Erant hostiae majores infore constitutae, quae ab his
praetoribus de tribunali, sicuta nobis consulibus, de consilii sen·
tentia probatae, ad praeconem et ad tibicinem immolabantur.
