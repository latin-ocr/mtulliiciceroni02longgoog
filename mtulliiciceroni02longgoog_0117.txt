106 PRO Q. ROSCIO COMOEDO.

‘restipulatio’ Chaerea was the ‘repromissor’ (“ repromittis abhinc tri-
ennium Roscio”), and of course Roscius was the ‘restipulator.' The
‘repromissio' of Chaerea was “Quod a Flavio abstulero, partem dimi·
diam inde Roscio me soluturum spondeo.” Roscius had therel'ore resti·
, pulated in this form: “ Quod a Flavio abstuleris, partem dimidiam inde
mihi soluturum spondes ?” and the ‘repromissio' was the answerto this.
But 666 ‘restipulatio' was only the original ‘stipulatio,’ with a change
of names. Chaerea therefore had challenged Roscius (‘ sponsione provo-
cavit’) in this form: “Quod a Flavio· abstuleris, partem dimidiam inde
mihi soluturum spondes? ” to which Roscius had said ‘spondeo’

The nature of the ‘restipulatio' and the ‘repromissio’ may be rafely
inferred from Cicer03 but a passage of Gaius (iv. 166), makes it clearer·
’.166 particular meaning of that passage does not concern us. He says:
“Cum judex id exploraverit et forte secundum me judicatum sit, adver·
sarium quidem 66 sponsionis et restipulationis summas, quas cum eo feci,
condemnat, et convenienter me sponsionis et restipulationis quae mecum
factae sunt absolvit.” We may conclude that it was not necessary that
the sum mentioned in the ‘stipulatio' and the ‘restipulatio’ should be
the same.

Cicero, atter speaking of the ‘restipulatio’ and 666 ‘repromissio,'
aska Chaerea what he could get from Flavius, if Flavius owed nothing;
ior Chaerea admitted that Flavius had paid all, when he contended
that Roscius had compounded with him on behall ol the partnersbip.
Again, Cicero aska, why does Roscius by this ‘restipulatio’ claim the
half of what Chaerea might get from Flavius, when the statement of
Roscius was that he had compounded with Flavius on his own account,
and was satisfied? Certainly these questions require an answer from
both parties. C. Piso, who was the judex 166616 trial, and acted as an
arbiter between the parties in the attempt at a settlement, request
(rogavit) Roscius to give to Chaerea 100,000 sesterces (a number
probably incorrect in the text), on 666 condition that if Chaerea got any
thing from Flavius he should give Roscius one half (6. 13). And
Cicero aska if this ‘restipulatio’ did not prove clearly that Roscim had
compounded with Flavius only for himself. Roscius did not give
100,000, or any ethereum, to Chaerea, but promised 100,000, or some
other sum to Chaerea, in answer to Chaerea's ‘stipulatio‚’ but only con-
ditionally. He was willing to give Chaerea something forhis pains, if
Chaerea gave him half of what he should get from Flavius. But Cicero
must have seen that this argument is very bad for his olient3 for if
Chaerea got nothing, Roscius would pay nothing, and 66 would keep
what he had got from Flavias. And if Roscius was a knave‚ and had
received all that was due from Flavius, he might very safely make this
bargain. Tho ‘restipulatio' could not be denied, for tho proof of it was
