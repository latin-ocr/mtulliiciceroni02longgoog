384 INTRODUOTION.

It is not said when this payment of a tenth and of the other charges
was established: but if we interpret Appian’s words fairly, be under·
stood the payment to be as old aa tbe existence of the Ager Publicus.
The lande thus occupied were called ‘occupatorii' a name which ex·
plains itself, or Arcilinales, ‘⁸ land which was not surveyed and measured,”
(Siculus Flaccus, ed. Lech. p. 1383 Frontinus, De Agr. qual. p. 5).
But this occupatiori gave no title of ownership, and a title could not ba
acquired by uss (usucapio). The land still belonged to the Roman
people (Frontinus, De Controv. Agr. p. 50; Agennius, p. 82; Cicero,
contra Rullum, iii. ¹3). The land which was assigned (‘ assignatus ’)
became private property; and it is called Ager or Ager Privatus, as
opposed ιο that which was merely held by permission, which kind of
occupation was called Possessio. Some modern writers refusa to believe
the ancient writers, such as Appian (B. G. i. 7) when they tell us how
the Possessores got possession of tha public land. But what the ancient
writers tell us is much more intelligible, much more probable than any
of the assumptione that I have seen in any modern writer. The stata-
ments of the ancient writers are simply tbis3 that all the public land
was not disposed of, Some was assigned, some was sold, some was lat3

, and we may certainly conclude that what was sold and let was that

which for different reasons would easiest find purchasers and tenants.
It is not surpriaing if there were tracta of good land, which could not
find either purchasers or tenants, for purchasers and tenants must have
capital, and land may be more plentilul than capitulas it isin some
countries now. If Italy was very populous when the Romans began
their conquering career, in which they never stopped, war, and famine,
and pestilence‚ the consequence of war, would thin its population, and
Rome itsels, whose men were cousumed in war, did not reproduoe them
’ fast enough to fill all Italy. If the enjoyment of the lands, which were
left unsurveyed‚ unsold, unlet, was tha privilege of a class, of the Roman
‘nobiles' or even if all who had capital might use them, we need not con·
cern ourselves much as to the way in which they got possessiones the
land. So long as there was enough, a man might take what be wanted
(Dionys. viii. 69, dc). When the number who were willing or able to
oocupy public land became larger, we may suppose that some mode of
occupation could be settled just as easily as land could be sold or let ¹.
Itis certain that much of the Italian land was used for fecding, and it
was, as already observed, the only way in which distant lande could be
profitably used. The occupiers of course placed people on the land ιο
loolr after their cattle, their clienta it may be; and such arrangements
would be made with these clienta as would bring profit to the capitalist
