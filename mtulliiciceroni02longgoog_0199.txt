interdict 10 vi, simply, without any additium sometimes, when the
circumstances required, it was an Interdictum de ri armatu The usual
forcible ejection had accordingly no particular name. Oicero distin·
guishes it by the term ‘wia quotidians’ (Pro Caecina, c. 32); and the
Interdict applicable to such a case he calls Interdictumlquotidianum
(c. 31); which however is not a technical term, but merely expresses
that it was the Interdict in common uae. This common interdict ‘de vi,’
or ‘quotidianum’ was 01 110 following form, as Keller gives it:

“ Unde tu N umeri N egidi aut familia aut procurator tuus Aulum Age·
rium aut familiam aut procuratorem illius in hoc anno vi dejecisti, qua
de re agitur, cum ille possideret, quod nec vi nec clam nec precario a 10

possideret, eorestituas.'’ ,
une principal passages which establish the truth 01 this formida are

the following: Cicero, Pro Tullio, § 44, 453 Lex Thoria, cap. 7, 01.
Budorff, Zeitachrist fur Geschicht. R. W. X. p. 151, duc.; Cicero, Pro
Caecina, 019, 30, 31, 323 Gaius, iv.154; Cicero, Pro Tullio, ς 29;
Ulpian, Ad Edictum de Vi et Vi armata, Dig. 43. 16. 1, ³9.

The only direct proci that is wanting as to the form 01 this Inter·
dict relates to tha words, ‘Qua de re agitur ;' but it was a common legal
formula, of which we have examples in the oration Pro Murena, c. 13;
and 10 the Brutus, c. 79: “ Qua de re agitur autem illud, quod multis locis
in jurisconsultorum includitur formulis, et ubi esset, videbat.'' Keller
shows or attempts to show the use 01 the words ‘Qua 10 re agitur.’ 'I'he
Interdict is expressed in general terma, and does not mention the place to
which it applies. The general terma are Unde and Eo; and this gene·
rality gives Cicero the opportunity of arguing (c. 28, 29) that it males
no differcnce whether Caecina was ejected srom the Fundus Fulcinianum

’ or from any other place; that the Praetor’s Interdict did 001 say ‘what

place ;' and accordingly that Caecina must get a judgment on the Spon-
sio, 11 he had been ejected from any place and had not been restored to
tha same place ; which ia a manifest bit 01 sophistry. une words ‘Qua
de re agitur-,³ which indicate ‘the thing that comes¹ in question‚’ the
land in this case about which the disputo is, are adapted to meet such a
sophistical argument. Keller ingeniously observes that 11 isno objec-
tion to his supposition 01 these words being in the Interdict, that Cicero
takes no notice of them. There might be good reasons for that: and it
is more likely that he should say nothing 01 these words, which were a
difficulty 10 him, than that they should be omitted in this Interdict when
they appear in other Interdicts, as in the Interdictum Uti possidetis
(Dig. 43. 17. 1 : Uti eas aedes, quibus de agitur) and in others.

As to the Exceptio expressed by ‘cum ille possideret quod nec vi nec
clam nec precario possideret,’ Savigny(Das Recht der Besitzes, ᾗ 40) main·
taius that these words were 001 10 the Formula, though he contends that
