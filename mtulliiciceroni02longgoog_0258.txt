INTRODUOTION. 247

· Mithridates was threatened by three Roman armies, 0010100 hythe
king 01 Bithynia; but he was prepared for all 01 them. He defeated
Nicomedes in 0 wide plain on the river Amnius, which was probably a
branch of the Halys (Appium, Mithrid. 18). After this victory gained
by inferior numbers Mithridates defeated the Roman commender Μ’.
Aquilius, who fied to Pergamum. The two other Roman commandere,
1.. Cassius and Q. Oppius, retreated before the king of Pontus, who
entered Phrygia aud “ overran Mysia and Asia, which the Romans had
lately acquired; and sending round to the neighbouring parts he brought
under him Lycia and Pamphylia, and the regions 00 far as Ionia” (Ap-
piru, Mithrid. 20). Both Oppius and Aquilius fell into the hands 01
Mithridates, who put Aquilius to a cruel death at Pergamum (App.
Mithsd, c. 21), 0 punishment which was in some degree just, for be was
the cause of the war. .

On the news of the invasion 01 Western Asia, the Romans declared
war against Mithridates, and L. Sulla obtained the provincia of Asia.
But before Sulla could leave Italy, Mithridates had persuaded the
Asiatica to rise against the Romans in Asia. Many thousand Romans
and Italians, 01 all ages and sexes, were massacred with the most pitiless
cruelty. The exact number that periched 10 001 known: the ancient·
authorities vary from eighty thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand.
But there is nowhere recorded a more bloody aud crnel 001 01 vengoance
than 1110 messuere in Asia (Appian, Mithrid. 22, 10). L. Sulla, on
arriring iu Graece with his legions, defeated (0.0. 87) 10 Βο00110 Arche·
laus the general of Mithridates, and took Athens, which was held for
Mithridates by 10101100. Ηο 1100 passed into Asia, where he found
Mithridates ready to accept the hard terma which were offered. Mith-
ridates retired from tbe pron'nces 01 Asia, Bithynia, and Cappadocia
(Livy, Epit. 83). Sulla, being in a hurry 10 return to Italy to look after
his own interests, left L. Licinius Murena with the army in Asia.
Murena renewed the war with Mithridates (0.0. 83) for no motivo, as it
seems, but to gratify his love of plunder and to have a triumph, which
be obtained without having done any thing to deservo it. Sulla sent
A. Gabinius to Murena with orders to desist from hostilities and to
return to Italy. Thisis called the Second Mithridatio War. Mithri·
datee made uso of this leisure to subdue tho inhabitants of the Bosporus,
the people in the south part of the Crimen (Mithrid. c. 67), and he gave
them bis 000 Machares as king. Mithridates still held part 01 Oappa·
decia, but he gave it up on receiving an order from Sulla. 'Phe death
01 Sulla (0.0. 78) relieved Mithridates from all further fear, and his first
measure was to persuade Tigranes to enter Cappadocia. Tigranes
carried off a great number of the people, whom bo settled in bis new city

of Tigranocerta. 'Phe Romans knew that Mithridates had instigated
