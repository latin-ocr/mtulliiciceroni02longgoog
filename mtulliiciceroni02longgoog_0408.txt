the right passed to the ‘heredes’ (3. c. 41). vhe Decumae agri Leon·
tini were not let in Rome, but in Sicily, to Siciliau Decumani according
to the Lex Hieronica (3. c. 46). Consequently there can be no doubt
that the words ‘is ager a censoribus locari solet' (Verr. ii. 3. c. 6) are
to be understood of the letting of the land itself, which letting was ¹
rencwed at ¹every ‘lustrum ’ in the case oi land that had become vacant,
and the same thing was done in Sicily which we have proved to have
been done iu the matter of the Ager Campanus. Further, all this ex·
plaina how the Ager Leontinus, if it was originally given back to the
Leontini without sale, aud there could be no sale in the case of Agar
Publicus, gradually passed into other hands.”

The pasturc landa in the provinces, which were the hills audather
places not fit lor agricultural purposes, vvere let to the Publiceni by the
Censores at Rome. The persons who wished ιο seed their animala on
these lande applied ιο the Publiceni, vvho registered the animala and ¹
received a certain sum (scriptura) for each animal (Varro, R. R. ii.
1. 16: “ neque eadem loca aestiva et hiberna idonea omnibus ad pascen-
dum. Itaque greges ovium longe abiguntur ex Appulia in Samnium ⁸
aestivatum atque ad publicanum profitentur, nc si inscriptum pecus
paverint lege censoria committant ”). This practice existed in the king-
dom of Naples when Swinburne wrote (Travels in the Two Siciliea in
the years 177 7-1780). vhe oustom house for the toll on sheep that

assessment upon all sheep that descend in autumn from the mountaiua

return ιο the high country” (Travels, Vol i. p. 140). Swinburne’s
account of the regulations of Alionso the First about these cuatorna and
the sheep is very instructive. Among other things the king agreed
with the graniers aud sheep-masters of Abruaao and the landowners of -
Puglia to make a “convenient road called the Trattura, sirty praes
wide, for the passing and repossing of the'flocks.” 'Phia is one of the
