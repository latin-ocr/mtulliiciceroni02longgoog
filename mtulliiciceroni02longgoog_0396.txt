INTRODUOTION. 387

When 116 possession 61 land was secured, 11616166 61 11 would 16
1661666611 11 116 61661166 61 buildings, and by other improvements3 and
a man is always ready to consider 111 own that on which 16 has laboured
and which he has improved. And this 11611611 16 right; for neither land
nor any thing else in its natural state has any realwalue: all the 161116
1161 11 has eomes from labour. The cultivation 61 116 best part 61 6
Possession would follow in course 61 time; and it would also ba in the
nature 61 things, that is, it would be consistent with 161661 gain, 16
avoid the payment of the money 161 116 use 61 116 public land (Lis. 11.
36; Dionys. Rom. Ant. viii-74). For a payment was always dua to
the state in respect 61 1116 public land, which paymont would both be 6
aomos 61 ravenue and au evidence 1161 116 land was public (Lis. xxxi.
13). 'I'he public land which was thus possessed, was dealt with by the
Possessor as 1116 had the ownership, aud in 1661 16 could not deal with
it in any other way, for his Possession was as exclusiva as 11 11 had 116611
ownership. He 616116 could use and eujoy the land which he possessed3
every other person was excluded from the use and enjoyment. There·
1616, except as against the state, his Possession might he defined exactly
iu the 161166 in which ownership 61 land is dehned; aud the deflnition
61 ownership is simply this, the right to the possession and enjoyment
of land to the exclusion 61 611 persons. Ownership is a right which is
good against all the world; a right which the 61616 recognizes. The
possession was 6 right good against all the world, and so 16111 was
recognized by the state; but the 61616 did not recognize the Possession
as 6 title which the state would 1161 disturb. A Possessiou 61 Public
land passed from father 16 6611 (‘ quasi jure hereditario,’ Florus iii. 13) 3
it was sold, it was given in marriage porticus, and it was mortgaged. It
is only from writers who speuh 61 116 16161 times 61 116 Republic that
we learn 11616 16616, but the nature 61 116 case shows that from the
time when a man 1161 protoctcd in his Possession, the Public land was
considered hy the Possessor as 6 kind 61 property. Oieero then (De
011. ii. 22, 21]) might justly 661, “What equity is there in this, that
61161 land hasbeen possessed 161 many years 6161611 many generations,
6 man should have it, who 1161611611 it before, and that he who has had
it, should lose 11 ?’' and again: “Why so? that when I have bought, ,
and built, when 1 take 6616 61 116 land and 161 out my money 61111, you
should enjoy against my will what is mine !‘’

Still the land was the property 61 116 state. If a Possessor died
without any next 61 hin, and without having made any disposition 61116
. Ρ66666616111111111, the Possessio was vacant; and we must not assume
that it was 1611 16 any person 16 66166 11, though such irregularities
might huppen, particularly in tha 66111 periods 61 116 Roman conquesta.
But when Possession was recognized 66 aRight, 61666111 Possession
