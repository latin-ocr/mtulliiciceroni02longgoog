INTRODUGTION. 55

for this oration was delivered in 999 consulship of L. Sulla Felix and
Q. 1199991199 Ρ199, u. 9. 80, and in the year aster the oration Pro P.
Qurill'ttblibeing engaged two years as an orator, Cicero visited Athens
and Asia (Brutus 9. 99). 19 appears then that he left Rome after
delivering this speech, forthe purpose of his health and improvement, as

lgpsshsaym but, ss Plutarch found somewhere (Oioero c. 3), for fear of

Among the numerous Leges enaeted during the power of L. Cornelius

Sulla, wasa Lex Cornelia De Sicaniis et Veneficio (Dig. 48. Pit. 8). ⁴

'Pharo is no evidence that 9 Lex de Parricidiis was anacted during
Sulla’s time. The Titleofthe Digest which treats of 9919 crime, is Lex
Pompeia de Parricidiis (Dig. 48. Tit. 9). Phe Lex Pompeia, which was
enacted uo. 55, declared that the murderer of a father, mother, and so
forth, should be liable to the penalties oi the Lex Cornelia De Sicanis
(Marcianus, Dig. 48. 9. 1); aud in another excerpt under this litle .
(l. 9) itis said that the punishment oi Parricidium (more majomm)
was the culleus or sach. This punishment existed under the empire.
Itwas sn old punishment, and not anacted by the Lex Pompeis, for it
is stated that 999 penalty of Parricidium defined by 999 Lex Pom·
peis, was that which was lixed by the Lex Cornelia De Sicariis. Now
this is ambiguous. We might infer that the punishment of assaesius
'and poisoners hythe Lex Cornelia was the saek; but we know that
the punishment was different (Dig. 48. 8. 3. § 9 ι “Legis Corneliae de
sicariis et veneficis poena insulae deportatio est, et omnium bonorum
ademptio''). The best solutiones the difficulty seems to be the as·
sumption that there was a chapter (eaput) in the Lex Cornelia de
Sicariis, which treated of Parricidium, and that the Lex Pompeia only
defined Parricidium more exactly. Or, as Schrader expresses it in one
- of the notes in his learned edition of the Institutes of J ustinian (Iust.
ir. 18. ξ 5, 6. p. 768): “Lex Cornelia de sicariis, quae homicidis solum
vertere permisit, parricidas manifestos ita excepit, ut more majorum
culleo insuerentur. Lex Pompeia eam confirmans, multorum propin·
quorum caedem parricidio aequiparavit.’' Other explanations, which
however are worth nothing, ere mentioned by Bein (Das Criminalrecht
der Bdmer p. 455, note). Schrader has collected in his notes all the
learning about the sack; and more than most people would care to

lmll'lie trial of Roscius was a J udicium Publicum‚. the nature of which

hasbeen explained (Vol. I. Judioia, Excursus); aud he was probably
tried under the Lex Cornelia De sicariis.
