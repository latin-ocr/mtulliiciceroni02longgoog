476 PRO ’0. RABIRIO.

killing It ia uncertain if this ch was enaeted in his first tribunate
mc. 102, or in his second and last tribunate nc. 1003 but probably
it belonged to his second-tribunate⁸ It appears thet this Lex de·
clared all violence against the Tribuues and the raising of civil disturb-
ance to be ‘Majestas imminuta’ (Cicero, De Inv. ii. 17,1s; who gives
the definition of ‘Majestatem minuere'). Rabirius might heve been
tried underthis Lex, but his enemies chose to make him submit to a
harder trial. rI'hey tried to get him condemned under the old law of
Perduellic on the charge of violence against the holy person of a 'Pri-
bunc. The punishment was still the old punishment, hanging, pitching
from the Tarpeian rock, οι· bchcading; with the confiscation of pro-
perty and eternal ignominy of the man's name. The pccplc votcd by
ballot since the Lex Caelia, nc. 107. We know no more of Caesar's
motivea in bringing an old man to trial near-forty years after thc aet
with which he was charged, than the brief notices tell us, which have

. been referred to. One cannot suppose that he did it honestly. It was

a party measure, one of the means by which this bold, unprineipled man,
sought popular favour; by maintaining thc'inviolable character of the
popular magistrates, even when they had declared war against the State.

(licere (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 1. c. 5, note) threatens Verres with aprese-
cution forPerduellio. But on this occasion hc and Hortensius defended
Rabirius; they defended the cause of the Nobiles against the popular
party, the cause of order‘and constitutional liberty, as they understood
it, against disorder and revolution.

Niebuhr (Preface to his edition of the fragment of this oration, Rome,
1820) thinks that Dion has misunderstocd the tn'al of Rabirius; and
that the Populus either never was assemblcd to try Rabirius for Pcr-
duellio, or that· if this danger war removed in some way, Labienus still
attempted to impose a penalty (mulcta) on him. The ‘ inulctae irrogatio¹
(c. 3) was something like a Billof pains and penalties3 and in this case,
aa N iebuhr observes, it comprehended a great number of charges which
had no relation to Perduellio. Alsa, Cicero makes Labienus complaiu
that the ‘perduellionis judicium’ was destroyed by Cicero, and Cicero
himself, Niebuhr says, boasts “ se carnificem de foro, crucem dc campc'
sustulisse.” But Cicero does not say so. He says, “What istherc to
wish for that Ι would have liked better than this, that Ias consul should
have removed the executioner hom the Forum, the cross from the (lam-
pus ?'¹ Hc says that their anccstors would not allow this form of trial
after the expulsicn of the Kings3 that Labienus tried to restore it, and
that be resistcd it. Tharais no meaning in the speech unless Oieerc
was defending Rabirius against Perduellio. It is true that there is
something obscure and indefinite in the orator’s talk3 but if we chocsc
to make him aa clear as wc can instead of as obscure as'we can, wemust
