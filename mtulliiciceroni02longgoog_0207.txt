lac PRO A. OAEOINA.

unless Caecina was (legally) in possession, his case cannot bc compared
with the supposed case of Piso being presented from entering the house
in which he lived, and of which he had possession. Caecina (a. 3)
claimed to recover the possession by virtue of the Interdict3 and it
appears from what Oicero says (e. 27), that even if he had never been
in possession and was not ejected from the laud he must still be
restored tc the possession by Aebutius, if he got ajudgment in his ‚
favour. Keller concludes (p. 387) that Piso’s defcnce was just, when
he maintained that the Interdict had no effect unless the plaintiif, when
ha suffered the violence, either had been in possession or was corporeally
on the land3 and that Oicero rather relied on the words of the Interdict‚
while Piso relied on the equity cf the case and the real meaning of the

, Inter-dict. And this appears to be ajust conclusion.

Ishall conclude this tedicus but necessary introduction with the
following mmark in Keller's Latin.

“ Quod si praeterea Caecinae caussa id quod satis est credibile, aequi·
tatem quandam habere videretur, quia forte, quse de emptione fundi
Cicero narrat, opinione hominum plus quam legitimis probationibus ad
capiendos recuperatorum animos valerent 3 tum *quia fortasse Aebutius
fimdi possessionem, ex morte Caesenniae quasi vacuam urspensamque,
aride magis et callide quam honeste occupasset atque Caecinam herc·
dem possessoremque bonorum, paucis diebus praevenisset 2-facili hercle
negotio salvaque recuperatorum et religione et fama, quod tum inter·
dicti jus obtinebat, fieri potuit ut probabilem etque adeo justam caussam
Caecina habere videretis: quamquem illi minime sunt stultitiae dam·
nandi‚ quibis prius dubitaverunt quam secundum Caecinam judicarent”

It is not known if Cicerc's client won his cause, but it has been in·
ferred from a passage in the Orator ad M. Brutum that he did, for he
speaks of his oration aa if he were satisfied with it. But thiais not
a certain conclusion. There is some correspondenca iu the collection oi
Cicerc's letters between himself and Aulus Caecina, who calls himself
an old client cf Cicero (Ad Fam. vi. 7).

Ihare used for the text cf this oration Keller’s rancus readings
(Semestr. p. sas-538) and his useful notes cn the rancus readings.
Keller has used the ‘Lectiones venantes ad Orationes Pro A. Cluentio,
Μ. Caelio, A. Caecina, ἀεὶ by Am. Peyron, stuttgard and itihingen,
1824. 4. p. lea-2133 and also the ‘Variae Lectiones librorum aliquot
Μ. Tullii Ciceronis ex Codice Fhfurtensi enotatas ab Eduardo Wunder,
Lipsiae, 1827-ss He also collated eight MSS. which he describes.
Ihave compared the text also with Baiter’s edition of this oration in
the new edition of Orelli’s Cicero, where the readings are given mora
