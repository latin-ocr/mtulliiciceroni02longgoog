varied in different countrier, and the total amount would depend on the
rating. In some cases it was one per cent. on thevalue.

Sicily and Asia were not stipendiariae (Cicero, Verr. ii. 3. c. 63 the
notes). They paid ‘vech'gulia’ (τέλη), and not ‘stipendium' (φόρος).
I'he ‘decuma' or tenth, was the chief ‘ vectigal' (Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 3. c. 6,
notes; Excursus on Asia).

'Ibe passage of Cicero (V err. ii. 3. o. 6) might, from its generalterms,
lead us to infer that where Stipendium was paid, there was no Decuma,
and that where the Decuma was paid, there was no Stipendium. But
Sardinia, which was Stipendiaria, was compelled to contributa corn also
on some occasions (Livy, 23. c. 21. 413 26. c. 2). If there was Ager
Publicus in a Stipendiaria Provincia, this land also paid aDcouma, which
was the case in the Province of Africa. The Civitates Immunes, which
were free from regular taxes, were required to make extraordinary con·
tributions ; which was the case with Messana, a Civitas Foederata of
Sicily (Cicero, Verr. ii. 4. c. 9). The Provinciae Stipendiariae also were
sometimes required to deliver corn in place of part of the ‘stipendium 3’
and this was common under the empire (Hyginus, de limit. const. p.
205, ed. Lachm.: “in quibusdam provinciis fructus partem praestant
certam, alii quintas, alii septimas, alii pecuniam et hoc per soli aestima·
tionem”). Sometimes skins and hides for the uae of the army were
required. To secure a supply of food in the provinces for the troops,
public storehouses (horrea) were established, the existence of which is
proved both by inscriptions, the names in the Itineraries, aud passages
in the ancient writers.

Ibe indirect taxes were the tolle (portoria, Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 2. c. 70) on
goods exported and imported and goods carried inland, and by canals
and rivers. These tolls, though aholished in Italy in s. o. 60, after the
date of Cicero's orations against Rullus, were still raised in the Pro·
vinces for the benefit of the Roman State, that is, they were farmed by
the Publiceni. The ‘portoria’ in the Civitates foederatae, and the
Immunes, belonged to these municipalities.

We now see what awide field the law of Rullus had to work upon.
'Ibe substance of his Lex is explained in the following terma by areoent
writer (Dureau dela Melle, liconomie Politique des Romains, ii. 323):
“Immediately after Cicero entered on his consulship, the tribune
Servilius Rullus proposed a new agrarian law, which, under the pretext
of relieving the poor, delivered up to certain citizens all the domains,all
the ravenues of the Republic, and eonfened on the Decemviri who were
charged with ita execution an exorbitant power. The following arethe
principal heads: this law authorized the sale of the ancient domama of
the binga of Macedonia and of Pergamum those of Mithridates in
