INTRODUOTION. 107

in writing, aud Cicero had to explain this fact. He then proves, or

tries to prove (c. 14, doc), that Chaerea brought his action against
Flavius for the loss of Panurgus, and got 100,000 sestertii from him,
which of course would prove that he had no demand against Roscius.
He would have tc give one belf to Roscius, and Roscius would have tc
pay him what he had promised. We hear nothing more of this mans-
action in the speech. All we lmow is that Chaerea now sued Roscius
for oo,000 sestertii, aelear fixed sum (‘ pecunia certa’ c. 4); and the
origin or foundation of the demand (‘ caussa ’) was this, Whether Roscius
received what he did receive from Flavius ior his own share, or ou the
joint comunt?

Now the question is, what action did Chaerea bring against Rosciffl
As it was a ‘pecunia certa‚' Oioero affirma thet the demand must be
founded either on a loen, or au ‘ expensilatio,’ or a ‘stipulatio’ It wss no
loan, it was no ‘expensilatio,’ because there was no entry (‘ expensilatio')
in the books of Chaerea, nor was it founded on a ‘ stipulatio ;’ for there
was no evidence ot' a ‘stipulatio' ,What theu could the demand bei
It was not a demund for a general pertuership account, but a demand
for a fixed sum. It* there was no form of sctiou for a definite sum of
money in such a cese es this, except the three forms which Cicero men·
tiens, and if there vves no evidence that would support any one of these
forms of action, Chaerea had no cese at all. But we may assume that
he would not have brought his action without some show of right aud
of evidence to support it.

Several attempts have been made tc explain this speech. One is by
Unterholzner (Zeitschrafl fiir Onchieit. Rechtsro, i. p. 248). He
observes that the matter of the suit is certainly a sum of 50,000 ses·
tertii, which Obserea demanda oi Roscius (c. 1) ; that Cicero attempts
to show (c. 1-5) that Chaerea had no legal ground of ecti0n3 and
(c. 6-18) that looking at all the circumstances of the case, there was
no probable ground of action. The beginning of the first part of the
defenoe is lost, and the end of the second part also. It is chiefly from
the fragment of the first part that we must endeavour to determine the

nature of this action for a definite sum of money (⁴ pecunia certa’ c. 5). .

Unterhcluner concludes that the uction was cithera ‘condictio' ora
proper ‘aetio in personam! His notiones a ‘condictio’ is not exact, and
it is unnecessury to say more about it. He concludes that the mode ol
proceeding wcs by an ‘acti0,’ in which, as we see, G. Calpurnius Piso was
judex. This was not en ‘arbitrium’ but a ‘judicium' the difference
between which is explained by Cicero (c. 4) as clearly as it can be
explained. Ina ‘ judicium’ the phintiff demands aclecr, definite sum of
money, and he either geta judgment ior ull his demand, or judgment
against him. In the ‘ arbitrium’ the derum was sor what might appearto
