386 INTRODUOTION.

Roman territory, lor if they had not land these, and the chief part ol it, j

they could not have had property3 aud nobles are not nobles when they
have no property. But the increase of their fortunes began with the
conquesta of Rome, when the Patres and their clienta began to use the
Ager Publicus. It is a good evidence of the use to which these lauds
were originally put that we find iu Pliny the following (xviii. 3) ι “ Pe·
cunia ipsa a pecore appellabatur. Etiam nuuc in tabulis Consumis
pascua dicuntur omnia ex quibus populus reditus habet, quia diu hoc
solum vectigal fuit².” Phose lauda which were dsunt hom Rome and
which were not assigned, could not be profitably used exceptas pastum
landa ; aud if the Patres or the nobles had the sole right to this enjoy-
ment of the wastes, they had the opportunity of enriching themselves
by their ilochs aud herds. It is certain at least that none except the
rich could make use of these lauda, whether near to Rome or remote,
without possessing capitul. Permission to the poor to use these wastes
would have been worth as little as a treet of land in Australis or Zea-
land to aman who has no capitul. By the term ‘wastes’ herois simply
meant laud not occupied, not in cultivation It iswell known how
soon good land would beoom forest again, if it were lest without culti·
vation. Phe pasturiug of cattle ou the wastes of a new country, or a
country that has lost its population‚ which is the same thing, is a more
practicable and a more profitable way os using the laud than agriculture
or tillage. These Roman pastura landa were not marked by any artifi-
cial limits; but there must have been some means of markiug theextent
of the land which a man occupied with his animala ς or the whole num·
ber of animale that a given tract could bear must have boen determined
in some way. 'Phe original occupation of this land was probably made
without order or method, as already observed. Phe mere lact of the
use and enjoyment of land would in timo be converted into the notiou
os holding, having, possessing, and enjoying us of right. In the reign of
Servius 'lullus ’ (Livy, i. 46; Dionys. Rom. Antiq. iv. 9) a division of
conquered land was made among the Plebs, but it was made against the
will of the Patres, who loohed upon such land in a manner as their own.
Phe occupatiori of these public lande must have been regulated in some
way in course of time. If the Patres could by a Decretum distribute
public land among soldiers, we may msume that they covdd regulate the
occupation of it by Possessores (Livy, 31, c. 41, 49). Phe Possessores
who had by use got a kind of title were protected agaim invasion os
their Possession by the interdict of the Praetor. Thus the Possession
became a Right, and one that could he maintained by a Possessor

against any person.
