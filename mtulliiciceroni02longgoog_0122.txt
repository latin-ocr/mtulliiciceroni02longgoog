- INTRODUOTION. 111

Thoas ‘civiles actiones’ at Rome which originated in contracts cr
quasi-contracta, were 111101 1110 two kinds-1. ‘Actiones stricti juris,’
also called ‘ condictiones :’ and 2. ‘Actiones bonae fidei? The ‘condic-
tiones' were 110111101101101101 ‘judicia’ The ‘actiones'bonaefidei’ were
‘arbitria’ The expression ‘ 1111011 juris actio’ does not occur in the
classical writers, nor in the classical jur-ists. It appears in the Insti-
tutione 01 1111111111 (11. (1.1 28). Β11 the rarity 01 this term is ex·
plained by the fact that the Romans had another name 101 these actions.
They called them ‘condictiones’ The ‘condictio ' 11 1 ι-0111111 1011011
1011011111] arising 01111 1 00111101 01 quasi-contrat, provided it is
also 01 the 111101 character, that is, if it 11 101 brought within the range
011111 wider competence 01 the judex by the addition 01 tha words ‘ex
ilde bona' 'Phia definition accordingly excludes 11011 the limita 01 the
‘condictiones' all ‘honorariae actiones,’ all ‘actiones in rem,’ all ‘actiones’
founded on ‘delicta’ and all ‘bonae fidei actiones.' In order to un·
deratand the nature 01 these ‘ condictiones,' we must 1111 know what
contracta 01 quasi-contracta could be the foundation 01 ‘condictiones ;’
and secondly what kinds 01 ‘condictiones' there were, and how they were
distinguished by their several effecta. Orin other words3 if we assign
ageneral name to a number 01 actions, we ought to be able to assign
the general character 01 all these actions3 aud we ought also 10 be able
to distinguish 11011010 another the actions which are comprehendcd
under the general name.

The investigation 01 savigny is long, and it cannot bc understood
except by those who haya 10110 knowledge 01 Roman law: but the
101111 may be understood. ’1110 principle which determines the possibi-
lity 01 1 ‘condictio’ isthis: au ‘obligatio’ is created between two persons,
and at the same time the (defendant’s) debtor‘s property is increased
out 01 the plaintiff's property, who has a right 10 demand back what he
once had, or an equivalent. uae simplest case is a 1011 01 money from
one man to another; 10111011 createa an ‘obligatio‚' arelation 01 debtor
1110111101. The debtor's propertyis increased by the same amount
that the creditor’sis diminished; and the creditor has the right to demand
back the same amount that he has lent.

With respect 10 the ‘formulae' 01101111 01 demand, there were only
three classes 01 ‘condictiones’ Ι. The ‘condictio' 101 1 1101 amount 01
money. 11. Tha ‘condictio’ 1011 definite thing, excepta sum 01 money.
III. The ‘condictio' 101 any object except the giving 01 1 definite thing.

(savigny, system, 11, Beylage XIV.; N 0. XXXII.) Itis only 11111111
01 these three ‘condictiones’ that we are concerned with here.
Cicero has said that there are only three causes 101 which a man can

demanda definite sum 01 money in a strict ‘judicium’ and that these are
‘adnumeratio’ (⁶datio’), ‘expensilatio,' and ‘stipulatio’ (Pro Rosc. Com.
