be fairly due, and of course no fixed eum was demanded by tha plaintiff.
Accordingly we might conclude, as Unterholzner says, thet this was an
‘actio stricti juris,’ tried before a judex.

Cicero, as already observed, says (c. 5) that an action for ‘certa
pecunia' could only be founded on three things: it must be either for
money lent, or passed from the plaintiff to thedefandant (‘ data,³ ‘nume-
rata' aloan), or the action must be founded on an ‘expenailatia’ or on

e‘stipulatio.' Unterholzner has an argument to show in what sense he ·

supposes that Cicero may be considered as stating the law truly3 but
the argumentis immaterial to ne. The ultimate conclusionis that the
demand of Fannius was founded on the Roman Literal Contract, as it
was technically called, or in other words, on the entry in Chaerea's
books (ι literarum obligatio’). He adds that Fannius did not found his
demand on a loen, nor on a ‘stipulatio’ for if he had, “ Cicero would
not have touched the point so slightly as he did.'’

The real ground then, he concludes, must without all doubt bave been
an ‘ expensilatio‚’ and that all the first part of the speech must have been ¹
directed to confuta the affirmation of an ‘expensilatio’ This ‘expen-
silatio’ isthe ‘obligatio quaelitteris contrahitur3' and Unterholzner con·
clndea that the action must hare been founded on an ‘ expensilatio.’ ll'his
conclusion is the only one that we can admit, notwithstanding all that
has since been written, Menard saw this very clearly, and has clearly
expressed it in his commentary on this oration. Oioero denies an ‘expen-
silatio,' buthe does not deny that there was an entry in the ‘adversaria’
of Chaerea. He maintains that Chaerea could not support hia action,
because the entry in the ‘adversaria’ was not transferred into a regular
‘codem’ Menard says : “Quaestio an id nomen quod in adversariis est,
neque relatum in mundum, peti apud judicem possit.” Unterholznsr has
made no remark on this matter of the ‘adversaria’ on which the whole
question turns.

It will assist the render to understand this speechif the nature of
some of these Roman contracte ia explaincd; and though some things
that will be said here are not directly pertinent to the matter, they will

0 help materially to a right conception of the whole.

'l'hose agreements to which the Romans gave the technieal name of
‘contractus' were divided into four chesas (Gaius iii. 89)= “ harum
(obligationum) quatuor genera sunt: aut enirn re contrahitur obligatio,
aut verbis, aut litteris, aut consensu.”

An ‘obligatio’ is contracted ‘re,’ hyan act or fact, when the creditor
lende something to the debtor, as ‘pecunia numerata,’ money, or wine,
or any thing else3 the intention of the transaction being that the thing
which is lent shall become the property of the borrower, who must
return things of the same kind and of the mmo vdua.
