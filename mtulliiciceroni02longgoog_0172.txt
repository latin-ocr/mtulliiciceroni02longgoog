INTRODUOTION. 161

that in the year before the year in which 116 was writing Gallia supplied
the army of Metellus in Spain. Pompeius wrote after the battle 011 the
Durius or 111116, and the defeat of Herennius and 7116 capture of Valen-
tia The year in which the supplies were sent into Spain ia fixcd by
Drumann at rac. 75, and the year in which the army of Pompeius win-
tered in Gallia at 66. 74. It is uncertain whether the third year of Fon-
teius' praetcrship was lau. 76 61 ac. 73. Niebuhr assumes 71167 Fonteius
began his Gallie praetcrship in ac. 75, 7116 year in which 11666117 sup·
plies to Spain, aud accordingly his threeyears' governorship must have
been completed in ae. 78. But the argument is not very clear ou this
point. Pompeius in his letter speaks of Gallia having supplied the
army of Metellus the year before (superiore auno), which may imply
71167 Gallia aided the Spaniah army before Fonteius was in Gallia, for
Metellus was in Spain in 66. 78; 61, if Pompeius is speaking of the
supplies of Metellus sent by Fonteius, he may refer 76 7116 year uc. 77,
7116 year before Pompeius went to Spain, which was rac. 76. But 7116
1111616 matter is 66 confirsed, that it is impossible to settle 7116 61116116-
logy further than this, that the Gallio praetcrship of Fonteius was con·
temporaneous with part of the time when Pompeius was in Spain.

1116 year in which this speech was delivered is 1167 certain, but it
was after the enactment of the Lex Aurelia (6.6. 70), which took 7116
Jndicia from the Senators, and made 7116 J udices eligible from the
Senatores, Equites, and Tribuni Aerarii.

Fonteius was tried as it seems under the Lex Cornelia Repet. (6.6.
81), which was founded on the Lex Servilia (6.6. 106, 61 105 ; but 7116
date 16 uncertain). 'Phe prosecutor of Fonteius was M. Plaetorius, and
the subscriptor was M. Fabius. The Galli of the Provincia sent their
witnesses 76 Rome to bear evidence against Fonteius, and among them
Indutiomarus,a chief of the Allobroges. 1116 witnesses in (16161166 61
Fonteius were 116111 Spain, Macedonia, Massilia, and Narbo, the soldiers
of the army of Pompeius who had wintered in Gallia, and Publiceni and
671161 Romans who had been in (1111116 during the praetcrship 61 1611-Ι
761116. This prosecution and the defence must have cest a large sum of
money. The case was heard twice, or rather adjourned from 7116 first
hearing to the second3 which was allowed both by the Lex Servilia and
the Lex Cornelia.

The fragments of this speech belong to the second ‘actio 3’ and in its
present state it is obscure. ’.1116 fragment which Niebuhr discovered in
a Vatican Palimpsest supplies a part of the defect 67 7116 beginning of
the speech. Cicero in his speeches against Verres reviewed 611 the life
of the accused, all his public acts, though 7116 conduct 61 Verres in
Sicily was the only ground of the prosecution. The prosecutor Plae-
torius did the same in the case of Fonteius, and Cicero had 1167 only 76
