8 INTRODUOTION.

Keller, in his essay, besides the division entitled ‘Defensio in partes
locosque digesta’ (c. 9), 01 which I have just given a summary, has dis·
cussed the following heads at some length :- ’

§L Quae fuerit judicii origo et natura.

fi 2. Quo Jure Naevius ut bona Quinctii possideret a Praetore cum
postulaverit tum impetraverit.

ἓ 3. Generalis quaedam de Jure bonorum a creditoribus oum possi·
dandorum tum vendendorum. ·

5 4, 5, 6. 3131101111 quaestiones.

1 7, 8. Alfenus Quinotium absentem 11011 defenderit neone.

These heads will show what kind 01 matter isoontained in this oration.
My plan required me to place in notes rnost 01 what Keller has put in
the form of disscrtation; but I have omitted very little that 31 has
disoussed; and though I do not always agree with him, he is the first
person who has set the matter 01 this oration 1n a clear light.

The difficulty 01 131 subject, the misunderstanding and the blunders 01
the commentatore, are 1 sufficient apology for the length 01 1311 iutro-
duction and the notes. If this oration 01 Cicero 11 well understood, it
will help a student towards understanding others. He will see how
necessary it is to get a clear view 01 131 matter, and not allow himself
to thinlr that under this simple, easy language 13111 1111 no difficulty.
He will also leam to read the speech 01 an advocate with a proper
1111111111, and to know that Cicero’s 11011 are not always true, aud
that his arguments are often directed solely to get a judgmeut in his
favour.

There is a remark by a great scholar on the reading of Demosthenes,
which is worth quoting here; 101 11 is very appropriate: “Noccut
autem aetati rerum imperitae ii scriptores maxime, qui obviis verbis,
facilique ac dilucido oratione complectuntur res ejusmodi, quibus oapi-⁰
endis multa antiquitatis doctrina opus est. Talis oratio quum saepe
etiam doctum deludat, fit plerumque illud, quo nihil nocentius esse
potest, ut qui immature legunt, multum legendo nihil plene et 10011111
intelligere discant-Nam constat hos qui in Academiam delati nihil nisi
magna et nobilia nomina scriptorum loquuntur, quos cognosse sibi, si diis
placet, in scholis contigerit, eosdem 1111 reperiri inscientissimos, et in
primis doctrinarum elementis mdes-Atque adeo quis 10111111 non
male judicet, qui hoo totum genus lectionis dicat ad virilem aetatem

rectius reservari.” (F. A. Wolf. Demosthenis Oratio 11111111 Lepti·
nem, Epistola ad Boia, p. x.)
