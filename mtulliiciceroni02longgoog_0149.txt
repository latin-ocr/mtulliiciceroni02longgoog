138 PRO M. TULLIO.

(Semestrium ad M. Tullium Ciceronem Libri Sex), who made use of
the labours of Mai, Peyron, Beier, and Huschke. Keller-’s work is long,
but the value of this fragment of Cicero is a sufficient epology for the
length. What follows is from his work; and ifit is well understood,
the fragment may be read almost without the explanation of notes.
Keller has also printed the Argumentum of Huschke, with whom he
agrees except on a few matters, which he has discnssed at some length.
But any render may learn as much of the facts of the csse from the
fragment aa from any body's argument. Ihave not given an argument,
because, as Keller says, ss to the ‘res quomodo gesta sit,’ “none
maionis fragmentis nisi adhibita conjectura ac diunandi quadam arte
confici potest.” And conjecture and divination are not worth much.

unc formula in the action of Tullius was this (§ 7) = “ Quantae pecu·
niae paret dolo malo familiae P. Fabii vi hominibus umetis coactisve
murnum datum esse M. Tullio? The formula in the ‘Actio vi bonomm
raptorum’ has been already given. By examining the nature of this
action as it appears in the more copious excerpts iu the Digest, we shall
have a better notion of its original character.

The ‘Actio vi bonorum raptorum’ was applicable to those cases of
theft which were committed with violence, or by assembling men to·
gether, armed or unarmed: for theft wss included in robbery (Gaius iii.
209). This action was also applicable to such acts of ‘ damnum' ss were
comprehended in the Lex Aquilia, if they were committed ‘vi out homi-
nibus coactis! But, under the empire, the action founded cn the edict
was applied to the case of ‘bona rapta' much more frequently than to
cases of ‘damnum’ Besides the existence of acts committed ‘ant vi
aut hominibus eoactis‚' it was necessary that there should be ‘dolus
malus? If a man did not commit the act of robbery or of ‘damnum’
himself, but got others together ‘dolo malo,’ who did it, he was liable
to this action3 or if he employed persons who were got together by
others3 or if he was oue of those who were got together for this
purpose.

The claim ‘in quadruplum’ was for the recl value of the thing which
was taken3 but,i11 the case of damage done', it was, we may suppose,
‘in quadruplum’ of the amount of the'demage. The ‘in quadruplum’
was not merely a penalty: it comprehended the velue of the thing
taken, or, as we may assume, of the damage done. It was, therefore,
satisfaction to the value of the thing or the damage, and three times
more (Inst. iv. Tit. 2). After the end of the year within which the
action could be brought, the demand could only be ‘in simplum,' for
simple restitution or asimple equivalcnt (Gaius iii. 209). The ‘heres’ of
the injured person had the right of action which his predecessor had3
bnt there was no right of action against the ‘heres’ of the wrong docr.
