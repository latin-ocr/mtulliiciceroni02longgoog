INRRODUOTION.

O. Fames Ouum (0. 10) 101 a slave Panurgus. It wes agreed
between Chaerea and Q. Roscius, 110 distinguished ector, that this slave
should be their j0int property; 1101 Roscius should instruet him in his
art, 001 1101 they should divide the profita 01 110 labours. Panurgus,
aster being taught by Roscius, appeared on the stage with great success;
but shortly aiter be was killed by O. Flavius 01 Tarquinii, in what
manner it is 0010011, noris it material to the case (c. 11). Roscius
commenced 00 action against Flavius sor the value 01 110 slave (ι judicio
damni injuria constituto’)‚ and his partner Chaerea was his agent in the
action (‘ cognitor'). Before it came 10 0 trial, Roscius agreed with
Flavius 1ο 101010 satisfaction of his demand a pisce of land (c. 11, 12),
01 0 time when the salue 01 1001 was low. Roscius said 1101100010

“Utrum Roscius cum Flavio de sua parte 00 10 1010 societate fecerit
pactionem'' (c. 12). If Roscius received this land 00 110 pertnership

An attempt 101 been made to settle this matter between Roscius ond
Fannius some years before this trial, but the 10010 are rather obscurely
