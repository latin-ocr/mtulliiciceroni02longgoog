INTRODUOTION. 109
The ‘obligatio verbis' is mode by certain formal words in the way of

question and answer, as, ‘Dari spondes θ’ ‘Spondeo' (iii. § 92). [lhe
words were necessary3 they made the ‘obligatio’ There must of course
be evidence of the words, that is, evidence of the contract, which
evidence was that of the witnesses who were present; and the evidence
might be, and sometimes was, reduced to writing3 but the solemn
words alone were the contract.

'l'he ‘obligatio litteris' is also described by Gaius (iii. 128), but it
may be that the characteres the thing was somewhat changed in his
time. The nenne of this contract has been explained before (Vol. Ι.
Verr. ii. l. c. 38). This ia the ‘expensa lata' of Cicero, as Savigny
has shown (Vermischte Schriften, Vol. Ι. p. 205, dcc). The contrsct was
formed by the entry in the plaintiff’s bools; and this entry was the
ground of bis action. It has been a great difficulty with the critice to
explain how an penny in the plaintiff ’s books could bind the defendant3
for a man cannot be bound (‘ obligatus’) in a contract, except by his
1 consent. This is quite true; hut the Romans supposed that if a man

entered another in his books as his debtnr, he had good reason for doing
so. If he demanded payment of this book debt, he must of course prove
itin some way. The entry in the books, according to Roman notione,
and according to our notione, is a presumption of debt sufficient to sue
on. If the debt is denicd, proof of some lsind must he given that the
entvy is a true entry. If both parties kept books properly, and both
were honest, the books of the two parties would agme; but that would
not always be the ease. The Roman ‘obligatio litteris' only referred to
the act of the creditor, “ qui expensum ferendo obligat ’¹ (Gaius iii. 138),
who binds his debtor by entering a sum of money as due from him. In
the case of the ‘verborum obligationes,' that is, ‘stipulationes’ the two
parties must be present, for the contract consisted in the one saying the
formal words, and the other replying in formal words. “But,'’ says
Gaius (iv. 138), “ absenti expensum ferri potest;’' which shows very
clearly that some transaction must have always preceded the ‘expen-
silatio,' and was the ground of the entry.

'l'he examples of the ‘litteris obligatic’ in Gaius may be, as Savigny
supposes, mere specimens, for he uses the word ‘veluti’ However they
are clear enough. He calls debts or accounts ‘nomina transcriptitia’
when the debt is changed in form, but notin substance. The first
example is when the debt is transferred, as he expresses it, ‘u rein
personam,’ or when a debt founded on a buying‚ or a hiring, or a part·
nership, is ‘expensum latum,’ which means entered in the book asa
bare sum of money due. [Phe debtor would not be bound by this
simple act of the creditor. But the written entry is obviously away of
preserving a record of the transaction, and when such an entry is mede
