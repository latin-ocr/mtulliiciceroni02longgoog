INTRODUOTION. 193

and Τ1111100011000 to be the ‘deductor ;’ and accordingly was to be
recognized 00 the person in possession. On this passage of the oration
Pro Tullio Keller remarks, “ we can scarcely doubt that Tulhus was in
possession of the fundus.'’ Keller concludes that Oioero’s argument
about the Deductio provee that Aebutius was in possession. But this
is perhaps not strue conclusion. The conclusion from the agreement
about the Deductio is, that by the act of Deductio Aebutius was to be
treated as the Possessor. The conclusion 11 1101 that he was Possessor
before the act of Deductio. On the whole it seems doubtful whether
Caecina or Aebutius had the Possession; it appears that the question of
Possession was 10 be settled 1)] tbe Deductio moribus; and 00 Cicero’s
argument may be good as far as this—there would hare been no talk
about a Deductio with respect tc this E'undus, if Caecina was not the
Possessor or did not claim 10 be the Possessor.

This part of the question isviewed by Keller as follows. Hs con-
siders Cicero's argument founded upon the fact of ancine wishing to
be formally ejected as 0 pieoe of sophistry, which he says may be put in
this forms

A man cannot be formally ejected (deduci) unless he is on the laud.
But he who is on the land isin possession. It must follow then that
Caecina is in possession, as he 00110 10 be ejected by Aebutius.

He affirms that the character of the ‘deductio quae moribus fit’ 10
altogether opposed to this kind of argument. He first shows from
Gaius (11. 16) what was the nature of the ‘legis actio’ when the ques·
tion was about the ownership of land. If the thing was 0 moveable
thing, it was brought before the praetor (in jus), and the ownership

was claimed 1)] each party in turn laying his hand on it. This was
followed hythe ‘provocatio’ 10 the Sacramentum. He who had first
made the claim said: “ Quando tu injuria vindicavisti 1) seris sacramento

1011101000.Η His opponent also said: “ Similiter ego te.” The praetor
then gave the ‘vindiciae’ in favour 01 one of them, that 10, in the mean
time he appointed one to be in possession, and ordered him to give
security 10 the other for the thing itself and the intermediate proiits
(praedes adversario dare litis et vindiciarum). If the thing could not
be brought into court, spart 01 11 was brought, and the ‘vindicatio’ was
made as if the whole thing was present: for instance a clod was brought

from the land, or a tile from the house.
When the ‘legis actiones’ were abolished, and the formida was intro-

duced, the plaintrff (actor) proceeded thus in the Sponsio: “Si fundus
quo de agitur ex jure Quiritium meus 001, sestertios xxv nummos dare
spondes;¹' and then he presented the formula in which he declared .
(intendebat) that the amount 011110 Sponsio was due tc him. In like
- manner the defendant had to give the plaintiff security bys peculisr
