INTRODUOTION. 473

Faitb, as the Romans term it '³ (Plutarch, Marius, c. 30). Cicero in
this oration (c. 10) does not admit 010011] that the Publica Rides was
giren 10 Satnminus, and thera was no reason why it should be.

It was 1001 1011] years 01101 the death 01 Saturninus when Ο. Rabi-
rius, 0 senator, now 01101001 11 ]0010, was tried 01 the charge 01 having
had 0 share in tha attack on Saturninus, and even with being the man
who killed him. O. Julius ansar is said to hare instigated Τ. Labienus,
whose uncle, Q. Labienus, had perishad among the partiaans 01 Satur·
ninus, to prosecute Rabirius (Sueton. Caesar, c. 12). 'Phe history of
this matter is told by Dion (lessius (mvii. 26-28). '

‘⁴ Τ. Labienus 1)] commencing the prosecution 01 O. Rabirius sor'the
messaara 01 Saturninus, caused very great disturbance 01 Rome; 101
Saturninus had been dead about six-and·thirty years3 and in the con·
test with him the consuls 01 that time bad received their instructions
from'the 801010. Consequently the Sancte by this trial was deprived 01

, the power to make 00100110, and 1110 whole order 011110 commcnwealth

was disturbed by it. Rabirius did not admit that he bad 111180111-
ninus to death3 he denied it. But the tribuni were entirely beut on
breaking the strength and destroying the consideration 01 1110801010,
and wera labouring to get the power 01 doing whatever they liked. For
by instituting 01 inquiry into tha consults 01 tha Senste and things
that had been done so many years before, irnpunity was offered 10 those
who attempted any thing 01 the like kind, and the power 01 punishing
them was cut off. Accordingly the Sancte both 101 other reasons
thought it 0 scandalous thing, 11 a senator, who bad done no wrong and
was now advanced in years, should perish3 but still more were they
indignant, 11000000 the first order in the State was brought into odium,
and the administration 01 public affairs was put 11 the hands of tha
worst men. There was 1101011 party spirit and contention on both
sides about this trial, the ona sida making an affort to prevent the court
being formed, and the other to secure its sitting. And when through
Caesar and others the latter party prevailed‚ again they disputed about
the manner 01 trial. Now Caesarhimsellwith L. (laesas was the judge;
for it was no simple matter that Rabirius was tried sor, but it was the
0110100 01 Perduellio; and they condemned Rabirius, though they were
not named by tha people according to the ancient custcm, but 1)] the
Praetor contrary to law. Rabirius appealed, and he would certainly

have been condemned 1)] the people too, 11 Metellus Celer, who was an ,

augur and Praetor, bad not presented it. For aa tbe people would
not listen to 01] 100001 from him, and did not take into considera-

* tion that the condemnation had bean made contrary to custom, Metellus

ran up to tha 1111011101010101110 people bad coma to any decision by
