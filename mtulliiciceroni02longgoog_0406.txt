INTRODUOTION. 39⁷

'Phe condition of the Foederatae Civitates, so far aa we know, was as

, good as that of the Liberae et Immunes. Phe second class of cities or

states was composed of those which had been reduced to subjectior by
force of arms, and of the royal domains of conquered countries‚ such as
'the demaine in Sicily, Bithynia, and Macedonia. These lande were Ager
Publicus. 'Phe lands of this second class were treated as the property
of the Roman people. All the rest of the land not included in the first
two classes was in the hands of Provinciales. ,

The Agar Publicus in the Provinces consisted of arable land, pastura
land, mines, and salt pans (‘ salinae'). When the Romans had acquimd
large foreign possessione, careful survsys were necessary, and thus the
office of Finitores or Agrimensores arose. Their system was perfected
under the Empire. Pho surrey and measurement of the Corinthiun
Ager Publicus arc mentioned in the Lex Phoria3 the Finitcres in the
orations against Rullus. Public land must have been surveyed when it
was sold in allotments. 'Phe allotments varied in sice. One authority
speaks of allotments of fifty J ugera (Siculus Flaccus, de Condic. Agro-
rum, p. 152, ed. Lachmann). 'Phese J ugera were square blocks of land,
or rectangular. A payment in the form of tenths was reserved from all
these lande, and tbe farming of these Decumae was let by the Consors
at Rome. Phia land was Ager privatus vectigaliaque, a term which we
find in' the Lex Thoria (line 49: ‘isque ager locus privatus vectigalis·
que'). But it is only called Privatus to show that the enjoyment was
appropriated, for the ownership was still Publicus. 'Phe land was the
property of the Roman state. The ownership of provincial land was
not completo ownership. The Roman state was the owner, a title
derived from conquest, and on which was founded the reservaticn of the
tenths, sor land which was completely Roman private property paid no
dues. Hence the doctrine in Gaius, which is true, that the Roman
state was the real owner of provincial land (Gmus, ii. 7. 26, 27. 46;
Agennius Urbicus, pp. 46, 47, ap. (locs).

Pbat which the state still held simply as Ager Publicus, was also lat;
and generally onlong leaser, or even cn perpetual leaaes, the origin of
the Emphyteusis (Hyginus, Ds Gondic. Agr. ed. Lachmann; Gaius,
iii. 145). So long as the rents or dues were paid, the enjoyment of the
land was secured (vectigales vocantur, qui in perpetuum locantur, id
est hac lege, ut quamdiu pro his vectigal pendatur, tamdiu neque ipsis
qui conduxerunt neque his qui in locum eorum successerunt auferri sos
liceat? Paulus, Dig. 6. 3. 1). When the territory of Capua was declarcd
Public land, the whole of it was let for a corn payment (Livy, 27. c. 3):
this was part of the land which the Les Agraria of Rullus proposed tc
sell. 'Phe houses in the town also were let (simul ut cum agro tecta
urbis fiuends locarentur); which shows that this was a letting in the
