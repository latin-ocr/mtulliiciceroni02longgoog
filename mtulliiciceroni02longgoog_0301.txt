‘ „R 290 PRO A. CLUENTIO ΗΑΒΙΤΟ.

‘anfion and to lay hold of his property. Oppianicus addressed himself
to a well-known assassin, L. Fabricius, who applied to Diogenes, a slave
of Cleophantus, the physician of Cluentius, and endeavoured to persuade
him tc give poison to Cluentius instead of the medicine which his master
prepared for him. The slave informed his master of the design of
Fabricius, aad thus not only was the scheme spoiled, but the poison

was discovered in the possession of Scamander, afreedman of L. Fabri·
cius. Scamander was tried and convicted‚ aad also L. Fabricius. Some
time after Cluentius prosecuted Oppianicus before the same Judices
who had convicted the two men. Cannutius conducted the prosecution
ior Cluentius. The man (quaesitor) who presided at the trial was C.

uanius. Oppianicus was defended by the 'lhib Pl. L. Quinctius. Op· .

pianicus seeing his danger, applied, as Cicero says, to Staienus, one of
the J udices, to whom he gave alarge sam of money for the purpose of
corruptiag the Judices aud securing his acquittal. Staienus lreptthe
money ; and-all the J udices, thirty-two in number, declared Oppianicus
guilty, with the exception of live of tham Upon this L. erinstius
declared before the people, that the J udices had been bribod by Cluen-
tius; and this charge was so far believed that C. Junius, who had been
Aedile, aad was looking forwsrd to the Praetorship, lost bis electiora
and was obliged to retire from Rome (c. 29). Oppianicus after his
condemnation went into exile, aad live years aller he died in the neigh-
bourhood of Rome (c. 62).

Sassia charged ber son Cluentius with having poisoned her husband.
with the assistance of M. Asellius. Two alares, Strato and Nicostratae,
were put to the torture several times to get evidence from them against
Cluentius; but they gave none. At last Sassia persuaded her step-sou
Oppianicus, towhom she promised in marriage ber daughter by Melinus
(c. 66), to prosecute Cluentius for the murder of bis father. A. attius
managed the case for Oppianicus (c. 23). Cluentius was tried before
Q. Voconius, ac. 66, ia the consulship of M. Aemilius Lepidus and L.
Volcatius 'Pullus (c. 54). Cicero, who was praetor in this year, under·
took the dafenes of Cluentius, who had no other advocate (a 70).

vhe charge of poisoning Oppianicus was easily answered, forthere
appears to have been no evidence in support of it. But it was generally
believed that the Judices iu the trial at which C. Junius presided had
been bribed to give a verdict against Oppianicus; aad this opinion,
whether true or false, seems to have been the circumstance which saraed
most prejudice against Cluentius. Itis true thatthe gnilt of Cluentius
did not at all depend oa the fact oi bis having bribed these J udices or
not; and the fact of the bribery could not be tried at the same time ss
the charge of poisoniug. Still if it could in any way appear that Cluen·
tius had used bribery to get 'a verdict against Oppianicus, this fact
