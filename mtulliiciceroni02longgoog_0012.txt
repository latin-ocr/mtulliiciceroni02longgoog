INTRODUGTION.

—-.-—..

Tuas oration was delivered rac. 81, when Cicero was a young man. It
is the first οἰ his extant orations, though not the first that he delivered
(Pro Quintio, c. 1). It is also one of the most difficult3 for the textis
doubtful in some passages, where the difference between the true and
the false reading affecta the understanding oi the whole oration; and
the legal question which is before the Judex is not very easily appre-
hended. Thoas who would understand this oration mustbe contentto
take the necessary paine, and if they do not readily comprehend
all that is said, they may impote it as much to themselves as to any
other cause, if their presumption does not g'ct the better of their
modesty. ,

uhe best commentary on this oration is in the “semestrium ad M.
Tullium Ciceronem Libri Sex,’' by P. L. Keller, Ztuich, 1842. Keller
has printed at the end of his dissertatione on this oration the various
readings oi thirteen Paris MSS, and a selectiora from a Bern MS. uls
, text which he has selected for comparison with these various readings is
Orelli’s.

It is very difficult to explain the subject in disputo between S.
Naevius and P. Quintius, for Cicero's statement and his arguments are
both confused. Sex. Naevius and 0. Quintius, the brother of Publius,
were in partnership in Gallia3 and when 0. Quintius died, he leit his
brother his heres. 'Phe death of C. Quintius dissolved the partnership
between him aud Naevius3 and the accounts ought then to have been
settled between Naevius and P. Quintius, the heres of Gaius (c. 3, 4).
It is impossible to learn from Cicero what transactione there were
between Naevius and P. Quintius aiter the death oi Gaius3· but he
affirms that nothing was due from P. Quintius to Naevius, either on a
partuership account oron any other account (c. 11). But Naevius
affirmed that there was something due to him, or at least he required the
pertnership accounts to be taken in order to ascertain whether there
was any thing in dispute between him and P. Quintius (c. 5, “nisi
prius de rebus rationibusque,” dec). After some delay‚ P. Quintius
