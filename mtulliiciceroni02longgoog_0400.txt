INTRODUOTION. 391

the debts of the plebeians did not ariae out of direct loeus by the patri-
cians, but from yearly ground-rents, to which as clienta they were bound
by their patrous.” That the debts did not arise out of direct loeus, ie
probablo, perhaps certain. The expression ‘yearly ground-rente’ I
reject ae unmeaning aud obscure, and uneupported by any evidence.

The substance in this hypothesis, which the author presente as a factis
probably true. The nobles got the laud iu large moeses, and they
could not mehe it profitable except by placing people ou it either as
shepherds, cattle feedcrs, or agriculturiste. In no other way than by
virtue of these Possessioues can we explain the existence of the enor-
mous estates of the Roman nobles in Italy, and the origin of the Roman
‘colonus' or tenant cultivator. These ‘coloni’ were in fact the repre·
sentativee of the old ‘clientes ς’ they paid a rent in money, or iu kind
for their land 3 and they often served their landlord in war (Caesar, B. 0.
i. 34, 56). Where the relation of landlord andtenaut emate, there debt
will exist also. Payments made for the use of laud are uncertain,
because the produce is uncertain, and the small cultivator may be ruined
by abad asason, or by losees of auy kind If he is once in debt, he
does not easily get out. One cannot conceive what revenue aRoman
noble could have except from laud; his client, or tenant (colonus) would
pay either in kind or in money according to agreement.

But after many assiguments of land had been made in different parts
of Italy, there was also a class of small cultivators and proprietors. Such
aclass is always needy, and'thosc who belong to it ofteu get indebted
by borrowing; and ao we may conclude it was in ancient Italy. We
also read of these poor people being expelled from their laude by their
powersul neighbours (Sall. Jug. c. 41), and though the act ol violence
was illegal, we must not therefore affirm that it did not sometimes take
place. Cicero’s Oratiou Pro Tullio is au evidence os the violence, the
petty war that was osten carried on in the remote parts of Italy between
men who vvere on terme of equality3 from which we may easily collect
what tools place when one man was rich and his neighbour was poor.

The object of the reforma of ri. Gracchus (a. o. 133) was to give laud
to the poor citizens, to restore the class of small land owners. His
Coloniae were simply bodies of poor citmens to whom land was to be
given to enable thern to live and to procreate. Ilhe Lex of Gracchus
limited the amount os aPossessio to 500 ‘jugera' aa the Licinia bad
done, but it allowed also 250 ‘jugera‘ to a Possessor in respect of each
son, and it indemnified the Possessor for what vves talren from him. A
commission of three persons, who were to be reuewed yearly, was ap·
pointed tc separate private property from the public land, and to msume

lor the State such' part of tho public laud in any man's possession ae
exceeded the amount allowed by the Lex. vhe indemnifying of the
