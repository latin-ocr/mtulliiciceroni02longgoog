common use of the term, and that to let the Public laud is to granta
leaeo of the land for a rent.

rho leerees of the Public land in the provinces were Romarm who
cultivated the laud (De Leg. Agr. ii. 31; Livy, 27. c. ὃς 42. c. 19) them-
selves, or in the remote provinces let it out again in smaller portione to
othare3 or the leeeeee were Provinciales, frequently the former owners,
who got back their laud, but subject to a yearly payment and to the
legal ownership of the Roman etate. As already obser-red, it is an error
to suppose that the land itself of which we have spoken was not let, but
only the tenths. It is plain from the ancient authorities that the letting
was a laaee of the land. The ‘Aroteres agri publici' were the lessees of
the Publicus ager: the other Aratores were cultivatore of their own ’
laud, subject to the payment of ‘ decumae' and to the legul ownership
of the Roman state. When the ‘aratores agri publici' had long enjoyed
their land and had improved it, they would think it as great a hardship
to be deprived of it, as a man would if he were ,deprived of the land of
which he enflad himself owner (Cicero, De Leg. Agr ii. 21: “ Qui ugrum
Recentoricum‚” dic). .

Tharais a note in Marquardt's continuation of Becker, which I shall
transcribe, as there are different opinions about these ‘aratores agri
publici,' and I am not yet quite sure whether the explanation given in
the notes (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 3. c. 6) orthat which is here transcribedis
the true explanation.

“ The condition ol the ‘aratores agri publici' in Sicily has hitherto
been insufficiently explained. The principal passage is in Cicero (V err.
ii. 3. ο. 6); “ Per-paucae Siciliae civitates sunt,” dec. The usual explana-
tion of this passage by Zumpt and Walter, according to which the
matter os this censorian letting was not the land itself, for this was
restored (‘ redditus'), but only the payments reserved to tho state from
the land, is just as false as the conclusion thence derived by Zumpt,
that all the towns, which Oicero does not mention amng those which
were ill-treated by Verres, are to be considered Censoriae, which had ,
nothing to do with tho administration of the governor in respect to the
‘decumae' or payments to the Roman state. 'Phe Ager Leontinus,

Ι which had suffered much from Verres, was ‘Ager publicus populi
Romani‚’ ae Cicero says several times (Cicero, Phil. ii. 17 and 393 iii.

9). Even il it was originally ‘redditus’ as we might infer that it was -

from the first passage cited above from the Verrine orations, this con·
dition was entirely changed in Verres' time. At that period no Leon-
tiner possessed any lauded property in that territory, with the exception
of one family (Verr. ii. 3. c. 46): the whole territory was letto eighty·
four ‘aratores’ (3. o. 51), part of whom vvere Siciliane from Centuripae,
and part were Romans (8. c. 18. 24. 41). The leuse was perpetual, or
