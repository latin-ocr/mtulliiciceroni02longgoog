does not appear that the Possessores lost much 01 what they had. They
maintained their Possessioues, and even increased them. Phe state had
Public land in 011 00110 01 Italy, far removed from Rome, and 111100

110 Public 1001, as we see in the 0000 01 Campania, and the commission
given to L. Postumius, the consul, to ascertain the boundaries between
the Ager Publicus and Privatus; for it was alleged that a great part 01
110 Public land was occupied by private persons who 101 gradually
extended their property by encroachments. This Publicus Ager, after
the boundaries were settled, was let by the Consors (Livy 42. c. 1. 19).
One 01 11000 passages in Livy is very precise and instructire: “ In the
same year 010100 part 01 110 Campaniam territory was recovered for the
publio 000 by the inquiry instituted by Postumius, the land having been
occupied (possessed) by private persons indiscriminately3 and M.

wants no labourers except himself and his family; 0 01010 would bea

Labour was 001 purchased with money, but labour was done by com·
