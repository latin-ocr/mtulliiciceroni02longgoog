rao Μ. FONTEIO
' ORATIO.

———-

INFRODUOFION. ι

Μ. Foarnms was the son os M. Fonteius, the legatus of P. Servilius
Caepio. The father lost his life at Asculum at the commencement oi
the Social War (c. la). The son filled many offices before he was
praetor of the Gallia Provincia. Cicero (c. 3) speaks of Fonteius
having been a triumvir and a quaestor, and of having discharged both
dutics ‘ante oculos ;’ whence Niebuhr concludes that the ‘triumviratus’
of which Cicero speaks was a ‘triumviratus monetalis: or a superintend-
encc of thc Roman moneta (mint). Drumann affirms that he was a
triumvir col. ded. s. agr. divid. Fhe quaestorship of Fonteius was after
tho cnactment of the Lex Valeria (c. 3), and before his legatio in Spain,
the timo of which is iixed by'Oicero (adventu L. Sullae) at ac. 83, in
the consulship oi Scipio and Norbanus (Liv. Epit. 85). This was the
year in which Sertorius iled to Spain. Ha was afterwards legatus in
Macedonia, during which tima he repelled a Thracian invasion.
There is no evidence that ho held tha office of praetor in Rome; and
it seems likely that when he was elected, he was sent into the Provincia.
During the campaign of Pompeius against Sertorius, Fonteius was
praetor of Gallia, und Cicero (c. 7) says that he was praetor during tha
year in which one of Pompeius' armies wintered in Gallia. Fhis may ·
show that Fonteius was two years at least in Gallia, as the army ol Pom-
peius would apend in Gallia tha end of one year and the beginning oi the
next. It appears to hasa been in the beginning of ac. 75 that Metellus
and Pompeius left the neighbourhood of the Pyrenees to recommenco
the campaign against Sertorius (Appian, B. O. i. 110). Fonteius during
his practorship sent supplica to the Roman armies in Spain (c. 6) ; but
we cannot leam from Cicero with certainty whether these supplies were
sent besore or aiter the army oi Pompeius wintered in Gallia. The
letter of Pompeius to the Senate (Sallust, Frag. Hist. Lib. iii.) says
