ORATIO.

——n-

INTRODUOFION.

Fun following are the laets on which the case of Osecina is founded,
and they are hese stated nearly in the form in which Klotz has stated
them in his presses to this onetion, though be is not always quite
amoram.

M. Fulcinius of Tarquinii, who carried on the business of a benher at
Rome, was the husband ol Caesennia. Fulcinius sold to his wife en

Dos in money, the women thus got the land in ploce of her Dos (c. 4).

(c. 5). The property wee bought by Aebutius with Caesennis’s money,
and sor her, but in his own name, ss Cicero admits (fundus sddioitur
Aebutio, c. 6). However Aebutius maintained that he bought the land
for himsell Caesennia took possession of the lund and let it (possedit
locavitque, c. 6) 3 end not long alter she manisd A. Caecius of Vola
