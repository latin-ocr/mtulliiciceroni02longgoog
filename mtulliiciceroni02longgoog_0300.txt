PRO A. CLUENTIO HABITO

ORATIO.

Ι sunnonuculon.

somnus numm ess a distinguished esem ornatuum (uano
Vecchio), an inland city in the north part of Apulia, near the riser
Tifernus. Cluentius died in the consulship of L. Sulla and Q. Pom-
peius Rufus, nu. 88, leaving awife Sassia, and a eon and a daughter
(c. 5). Soon after the father’s death his daughter married her kmsman
A. Aurius Melinus; but the mother spoiled the happiness of the young
couple by seducing her own son-in·law, and causing u separation cf the
husband and wife. Sassia afterwards married Melinus; and thus
became the wife ofa man who had been the husband of her daughter.
uhe young Cluentius took his eister’s part, and quarrelled with his
mother.

Melinus had a hinsman who was mmdercd at Larinum. Statius
Albius Oppianicus was suspected to be the murderer, and Melinus
threatened him with a prosecution. Oppianicus ssed to the camp of Q.
Metellus, who was one os the Roman commandere in the Marsic war3
and he soon returned to Larinum with full power from 1.. Sulla to do
what he liked. Being made one of the Quaerorviri of Larinum, he pre·
pared to avenge himself on Melinus, and to put out of the way others
who were dangerous to him. Melinus was proscribed and murdered.
,Sassia now married Oppianicus, the man who had caused her husband’s
death. From this time began a deadly quar-rel between Oppianicus and
young Cluentius, who instituted a prosecution against Oppianicus at the
instigation of the Decuricnes or Senate of Larinum. He charged Op·
pianicus with having declared the Martiales, or public servants of Mars,
'to be free men and Roman citizens. This prosecution excited the
fiercest enmity against Cluentius both of Oppianicus and his mother,
who wished to put him out of the way in crderto get rid of the prose·
