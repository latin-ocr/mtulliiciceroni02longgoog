simple sense, without being perverted ιγ modern ingenuity.

The Romane, ee we heve eeen, established coloniee in the conquered
territoriee. The coloniste had land eeeigned to them: they lived in the
old toene, und either cultivated their lande or let them ιο eume of tbe
conquered people. Ae eman murt either cultivate hie land, οι· let it if he
intende ιο get any thing out of it, we might melre thie etatement even
without evidence; but the cece of the coloniete of Antium ie an inetence
of the Reman coloniste letting their land for a chare of the produce.

There old Coloniae were like garrieonr placed ιο secure the subjectiones
the conquered people. Some os the land acquired by conquest wee eold,
though it ie probeble thet thie wee not osten done in the eerly period of
the Romen conquestu, for it would not be eaey to find purcbeeere.
Lende which were eold were celled Quaestorii, bccauw it wae the bnei·
neec of the Quaestores to eell them (Hyginus, in Grom. Vct. ed. Lech.
p. 115). Other lende were let by the Oeneore for a rent, ee it ie aeid by
Appien (B. 0. 1. 7). 'Phe Romen delinition ofe Colonia ia a body ol'
citizens οι Socii sent out by the State (publico coneilio), to form e Ree
Publiceor politicel community. It wae not a community independent
of Rome, but apert of the State. It wae deeigncd to put e Romen
population (Romane colonie) in tho place of that which wae destroyed
or driven out; or e Letin populetiou (latine colonia) which ebould be
subject to Rome. The destruction of the old populetion mede wey for
the Romen populetion oi Italy. A Romen or e Letin vvee planted
where another men hed lived before.

The amount assigned ιο e coloniet (eeeignatue, marked out) wee gene-
rally two ‘ jugera,’ e small amount, but ee much ae a man could cultivate
by hie own hunde, or with the eeeietence of bie family. A portion ol
land was reserved ιὀι common peeturage; end another portion wae eet
apert for religione and public purpoeee. 'l'bere wee land which wee
not aesigned or given in ownerahip‚ or applied to eny purposee: there
vves osten more land than the State could diepoee of. It could not be
sold ae public land ie in the United Statea of North Americe and in tho

Britieh colonico, beceuee there were not buyere enough. These who
hed capitul, and they were the only persona who could buy the land, got
hold of public lende, land which wee not assigned, on eeeicr terma then

by purchaee. They were allowed ιο oecupy weetc lande which belonged
to the State on payment ofa tenth of the grain produce and edith of
the produce of fruit tmen, the vine, the olive, and othere. Wuete land
doee not mean berron land= it meane land which ie not in cultivation.
They aleo peid a fixed rate lor enimele which fed on the public pectore
