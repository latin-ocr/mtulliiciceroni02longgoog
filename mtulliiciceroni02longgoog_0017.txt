6 INTRODUGTION.

Praetor might st his plsasure determine which of the two parties should
bo the stipulator, and consequently which must be the plaintiff in the
action on the Sponsio, and must prove his ease. Phis may be so, for
the Praetor could impose on the parties his own terme, ifthey could not
agree on the mode of procedure. He must however heve been guided
ln his judgment by such facts es he knew3 and Keller, who contende
thet the Praetor did right in referring tos Judex the deoision of a

⁶ question which, as far ss Cicero's speech shows, wss a very perplexed

question, also admits that the facts ns they appear seem to be in favour
of Naevius having hsd possession3 sud I have shown that there is no
doubt of thet, for Cicero says sc, buthe disputes the complete possession.
It is generally said or supposed by medem writers that the plaintiff iu
the principsl action was slso the stipulator, aud consequently the plain·
tiff iu the Sponsi03 and Keller admits that this was so, whenerer the
principnl action was comprehended within and decided by the ‘actio
praejudicialis? He does not gire an instance of such a csse. His oon·
clusionis this, ss to the ‘ actio praejudicialis,' the matter of the present
inquiry: “that when s praejudicium was necessary on account of some
secondary und incidente] question, it was just to consider on which of
the two the burden of the proof lay, end which of the two had the pre·
sumption in his favour, or (ss here) e show of possession3 and socord-
ingly to require him on whom the burden of the proof luy, to become,
the stipulator ond the plsintiff, and to allow him who had the presump-
tion or the show of possession in his favour, to be the promissor und
the defendent.” This is a just statement of the case; and the decision
of the Praetor is justified by what Cicero admits. N aerius had posses·
sion of part of the property, and Cicero tries to show that it wss not
such a possession as the edict and the law required, and therefore his
client was properly the plaiutiff in the Sponsio.

The nature of the question before the J udex being explained, it only
remeius to show briefly whst Cicero attempted to prove (Keller, p. 171,
ee). The whole matter is contained in the following words (c.10):
“Negamus te bona P. Quintil, Sex. Naevi, possedisse er edicto prse-
toris. In eo Sponsio facte est.'' Cicero divides this defense into three
purte (c. 10): “Nego fuisse caussam cur postularet (Ser. Naevius):
nego ex edicto possidere potuisse; nego possedisse.” The two first
divisions seem to be s matter of lsw. rue third touches the fact of
possession. As Keller understands it, if Quintius could prove any one
of these three things, he would gain his cause.

In the first division Cicero employs eight chapters (c. 11-18) to
show thet Naevius had no legal ground for nslring permission to seire
the property of Quintium and he attempta to prove this by showing
that Quintius was not indebted to Naevius, citheron a partncrship
