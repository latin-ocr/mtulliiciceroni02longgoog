112 INTRODUGTION.

ο. 4, 5). Though he does not use the word ‘condictio,’ he means the
seme action which in the classioal jurists is nomed ‘certi condictio,' or
‘condictio si certum petatur? The word ‘adnumeratio' or ‘detio'
comprehende even the case of a ‘depositum’ when it hes been misop-
pnopriated by the person with whom it wss deposited3 and the ease of a
‘condictio indebiti’ or oetion for the recovery of money paid under the
false opinion thet it was due; and other esses, which belongto 1. Cicero
says nothing of the ‘condictiones' of the two other classes, which is easily
explained, sorbeis only speaking ol' the ‘condictiones certi,’ which
arise out ol contracte. But there are also ‘actiones' which are ‘condio-
tiones certi,' and be hasnot mentioned them; st least if Savigny‘s expls-
nstion of the ‘condictio certi' istrue. But Savigny removeo this objec-
tion satisfactorily. Cicero was not attempting ιο lay down any general
theory of actions: he was stating only so much of the matter as
belonged ιο the case before him. When then he speaks of the ‘oduu-
meratio,’ ‘expensilstio’ ‘stipulatio' ss the three only grounds oia ‘con-
dictio certi,' he must be understood to mean such a ‘condictio ’ as heis
speaking os in this orstion. This was the case of s contract, and it
would have been pure pedantry, as Sevigny observes, if Cicero had
mentioned the other cases os ‘condictio certi,' which wem foreign ιο the
ι case. Fach of the three cases, of which Cicero speaks, is mentioned as
sevemlly being sufficient ground for a ‘condictio certi: or action fora
definite snm ol money. Consequently even the ‘stipulatio’ alone is
sufficient ground for suche ‘condictio' without supposing a loan to be
the foundation ot‘ it. Indeed the facts ol Cicero’s cese exclude the loen
altogether; for the foundation of the whole was s pertnership, end the
claim os Cbserea, which arose out of tbis pertnership and the transaction
betseen Roscius and Florius, could only be the foundation of a ‘condic-
tio oerti’ through the medium of an ‘ expensilstio’ or ol a ‘ stipulatio!
If there was neither of these canses ol action, as Cicero says, neither
‘expensilatio' nor ⁴ stipulatio,’ Chaerea must have hed judgment against
him; and his claim against Roscius ought ιο heve been brought in
another form, if he could lind any. But Oioero merely denies thet the
‘expensilatio’ was s proper ‘expensilstio’ Ae alresdy observed, ho
does not deny the entry in the ‘adversaria' which Ι understand to be
the ground of Ohaerea’s oetion.
