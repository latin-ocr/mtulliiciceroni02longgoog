186 PRO Α. CAECINA.

c. 6); to M. Fulcinius, a freedman of her first husband, out os the
remaining ξ, she gave{ (ex duabus sextulis), aud the remaining l
of the ξ (sextulam) she gave to Aebutius. ·

Not being content with the small share that ho got by the womau’s
testament, Aebutius began to raise a question about the ownership.
He maintained that Caecina could not take under the testament, because
Sulla had deprived‘tbe Volaterrani of the rights of Roman citizens (o. 7).
Cicero says that Caecina was in possession of the property and not
Aebutius, as Klotz and others erroneously suppose (c. 7, notes); and
Caecina determined to settle the disputo by commenciug an action for
a partition (familiae herciscundae). Itis shown in the notes that those
commentators are mistahen, who suppose that Aebutius commenced
this action. Finally Aebutius gave (laccius notice that the land, which
Cicero says that he bought for Caesennia, was his own, that he bought
it for himself. ’

Cicero says that Caesennia was in possession of the estate for four
years, from the time ol the purchasc to the time of 1011100711(0.7).
Aebutius admitted this, but he maintained that she occupied it only as
the ‘ usufructuarius' under the will of her husband (c. 7). Caecina
upon the advice of his friends pmposed to Aebutius, audit was agreed,
that Caecina should be formally ejected from the land (moribus deduce·
retur, c. 7), which was the first proceeding necessary in order to esta-
blish asuit for the decision of the question (Pro Tullio, 5 20, notes).
Caecina camo on the appointed day with bis friends to a ‘castellum’
named Axia, which was not far from the land in dispute, and there he
was surprised 70 hear that Aebutius had got together armed men, freeuren
aud slaves. Caecina aud his friends resolved to attempt to enter on the
land in dispute, but Aebutius had placed armed men both thare and on
the adjoiuing estate about which there was no dispute, the estate which
Caesennia had bought of her husband. When Caecina attempted to
enter upon the undisputed property, by which there was the nearest
road to the other land, he was met by many armed men (c. 8). Upon
this he attempted to reach by another road the disputed property (ad
eum fundum profectus est, in quo ex conventu rim fieri oportebat).
Being threatened with death if he passed a line ol olive trees, which
bounded 'the extremity of this estate, Caecina still continued 70 advanoe,
and only retired when an assault was made on him. Upon this hs
applied for and obtained the Interdict of the Praetor P. Dolabella, ‘De
ri homiuibus armatis,’' without any exoeptioual clause in it. The order
ol the Praetor was simply for the restoration of Caecina to the place
from which ho bad been ejectod. Aebutius replied that he had restored
him, which was only a formal way of denying that the Interdict was
applicable 70 the facts of the case. Iu order to decide the question a
