INTRODUOTION. 137

opponent of Tullius sent upon the land a body oi armed slaves, who
killed some of the slaves of Tullius, wouuded the rest, and did grean
damage ιο the buildings. Tullius brought his action for quadruplo

There is no doubt that we have in the edict (Vi Bonorum Raptorurn
et de Turba3 Dig. 47. ιίι. 8) the form of action in which Tullius saed
(47. 8. 2. Ulpianus ad Edictum) z “ Praetor ait: Si cui dolo malo homi·
nibus coactis damni quid factum esse dicetrrr, sive cujus bona rapta esse
dicentur, in eum qui id iecisse dicetur intra annum quo primum de ea
re experiundi potestas fuerit in quadruplum, post annum in simplum
judicium dabo. Iteni si servus fecisse dicetur, iu dominum judicium
noxale dab0.”

The edict speaks of two different things-of damage done to pro·
perty‚ and of rebbery3 and Cramer assumes that two different edicte,
framed at different times and by different praetore, have been blended
together in the writings οι the jurists. But this is a mere, hypothesis,
and it is not founded on any fact. With respect to the terme of the
edict, it might be doubted, as flavigny observes, whether the words
‘hominibus eoactis’ refer only ιο ‘damni quid facturr,‘ or both ιο thern
aud ιο the words ‘bona rapta? Perhaps the form of expression seems
rather to limit the ‘hominibus eoactis’ ιο ‘ damni quid iactum,’ though
it istrue that they may refer also ιο ‘bona rapta! But two other
passages ol Ulpian, in the same excerpt (Dig. 47. 8. 2. ξς 3, 12), clearly
show that the words ‘hominibus coactis refer ιο both acts of violenee;
aud the only reason for Cramer’s hypothesis is thas removed. The
edict forbids all damage which may be done by men who have been got
together for that purpose, whether this damage consisted in the destruc·
tion of any thing (damnum), or in rebbery. Cicero (ᾖ 5) only speaks
of ‘damnum ;’ bat Saviguy observes, that this does not prove that the
edict was different in (licere’s time from what it appears iu the Digest.
There was no robbery in the case of Tullius, but only damage done ιο
his property, his slaves, aud the buildings; cousequently the Formula
could only be applied ιο a case oi ‘ damnum,' and Cicero could make nc
use oi the other part ef the edict.

'l‘he occasion of the edict arose as Cicero tells us (ξ 8, aa), from the
acts of violence to which people had been accuatomed during the (livii
Wars. Under the empire peace and order were restored, aud conse·
queutly the edict was no longer oi the same importunes. To this cir·
cumstance we must attribute the differente between the original form of
the edict, and the form in which it appears in the Digest. This is
Saviguy's original view ci the matter. His essay was first printed in
the “ zeitschrift idr Geschieht. Rechtswissenschalt.’'
