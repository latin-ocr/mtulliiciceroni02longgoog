COMOEDO OAP. 16-18, 133

Nam jam antea H·S roco dissolverat. Deinde, si jam persuasum
erat Cluvio ut mentiretur, cur potius H·S cccmus quam cccmun
cccmoc ccciccc data dixit Fannio a Flavio, quum ex restipulatione
pars ejus dimidia Roscii esset? Jam intelligia, O. Piso, sibi soli,
societati nibil Roscium petisse. Hoc quum sentit Saturius esse
apertum, resistere et repugnare eontra veritatem non audet: aliud
fraudis et insidiarum in eodem vestigio deverticulum repperit.
Petisse, inquit, suam partem Rosciuma Flavio confiteor: vacuam
et integram reliquisse Fannii concedo: sed quod sibi exegit, id
commune societatis factum esse contendo. Quo nihil captiosius
neque indignius potest dici. Quaero onim potueritne Roscius ex
societate suam partem petere, necne! Sinon potuitquemadmu-

quod sihi petitur, certe alteri non exigitur. An its esti si
quod universae societatis fuisset petisset, quod tum redactum
esset aequaliter omues partirentur, nunc quum petierit quod
suae partis esset, non quod abstulit soli sibi exegit! XVI 11.
