INTRODUOTION.' 191

notiones Possessio 00 Usulruetuarius must have been 00 different from
1100011οο of Possession as owner, as the notion of Uslrfruotuarius is
different from the notion 01 owner. It may be true, and probably itis
true, that the Roman jurists gave the doctrine of Possession the form in
vvhieh it appears in the extant fragment13 and denied vome kinds 01
Possessio to be Possessio. But this was nothing more than giving
greater precision to the teohnioal part of their law; it was no alteration
ottho nature 01110 thing. The Usufruetuarius possessed as 110010110-
tuarius; he could notpossess in any other way.

Suppose that Caesennia was in possession3 Keller 00110, is this suffi-
oient resson sor believing that 0000100 vvas also in possession of
the land as ‘heres’i The anawer is very easy, even without any
reference to authority. 1,110110110001 Possession is the olearest in the
world, vvhen we understand by it Possession with the intention 10 1011
110 οο0’0 own. Either the Possessor holds the land, is on it, or goes on
it when he pleases, uses it as he pleases, and excludes all other persons
from ia, or 11 any one trespasses on his land, the law helpe him to
exclude him: or he allows another as tenant (colonus), or iu any other
way, to be on the land, and to use it lor oertain purposea, such other
person not affeeting to hold the land as hia own, but aoknowledging the
ownership 01 110 owner, though 10 may have by eontraet with 110
owner a right to alimited nse or enjoyment of the land; or he may
have 0 right independent of the owner 01 110 1001, and derived from
another, to enjoy it as Usufruetuarius. Caecina could not be in
possession as ‘heres' except by having tehen possession aa ‘ heres ;’ and
no more ean be said on the matter. It is true that the Roman juriata
lay down the law on this matter clearly enough ; but we really do not
want their evidence. Pardus says (Dig. 41. 2. 30. 5 5): “ Quod per
colonum possideo, heres meus, nisi ipse nactus possessionem, non poterit
possideres retinere enim 001010 possessionem possumus, adipisci non

. possumus.'' 1011010100οε(Β13.11.2.23)1’1110001010100100111011 ¹

sumus, adita hereditate omnis quidem jura ad nos transeunt: possessio
tamen, nisi naturaliter eomprehensa, 01 000 000 pertinet.” Nothing ia
more simple 1100 this. 'Phough the lavv may have given a man the
ownership of land, he eannot have 110 Possession without having done
some aot to take Possession. vhe English 10011100 01 Possession 01
1001 10 110 same. Possession 10 001 aequired by the acquisition of the
right to the land. Entry, aa 11 10 001101, 10 necessary, and with the
‘animus possidendi ς’ or the reoeipt 01 rent from a lessee for years, who
has what is called by us ‘the actual possession of the land,’ is the 00010
as entvy; 101· 10 who has the detention 01 110 land, he who oooupiea the
1001 and pays rent, admits that he holda it 101· him 10 whom the rent

10 paid.
