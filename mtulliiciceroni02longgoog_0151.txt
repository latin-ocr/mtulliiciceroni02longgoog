llo PRO M. TULLlO.

Edictum, between the time of M. Lucullus, and the tima when a settled
form of Edictum was substituted for the annual Edicta.

1. Tha words ‘Bonave rapta’ were added.

2. The word ‘ Familiae' was omitted.

3. The word ‘vi’ was omitted. Ι

4. The words ‘armatisve’ were omitted. uns most striking part of
the original edict is the word ‘familiae' by which the owner of slaves
was punishable in a penalty for their acts, without having done any
thing himself; aad he had not the choica of the ‘noxae deditio!
Under the empire, as Savigny remarks, and others also, the necessity
for this strictness no longer existed. Internal tranquillity was secured,
and the violence of private sends was ehecked by a supreme authority.
Nothing then was simpler than tolimit the action to the ‘dolus malus’ of
the master himself, and ιο apply the common principles of penal actions
ιο the acts of a Familia or of single slaves.

But what was done in the time of Μ Lucullus if a hee man com·
mitted ‘damnum vi hominibus armatis coactisvef' [Phe answer is that
sufficient provision was made for such cases by the Publica J udicia;
and this being so, it was annecessary for Lucullus to add any thing
more to his Edictum. 'Phe Lex Plautia de vi appears to have been
enneted rao. 89, and accordingly was in force before the Edictum of
M. Lucullus. Thus the Edictum of Lucullus is made intelligible, and
the Publica Quaestio da vi was maintained, while a new remcdy was
provided for a present evil. In a Publicum judicium it is manifest
that a man could only be answerable for his own ‘dolus malus! But if
‘damnum’ was done by his slaves, even at his instigation or by his con·
trivance, it would not always be easy to fix the charge on the master;
and tha best way of preventing such violence was te render him answer-
able for the acts whether he was privy to them ornet. This was what
the Edictum of Lucullus did.

Besides the Lex Plautia, thera were at a later time the J uliae Leges
De Vi, both the Lex of Ο. Julius Caesar and of Augustus. These
Leges were enacted rather with a view to the public interest than for
the advantage of him who had suffered ‘ damnum 3’ which was not the
case with the old Leges. But it may be assumed, that it was oon-
sidered just, at the same time, ιο allow an action against those who had
done wrong in the terms of the edict as it appears in the Digest3 to im·
prove the old action given by the Edictum of Lucullus, by adspting it
to the change of circumstances, and to remove all doubt and risk about
the ‘praejudicium’ which doubt had formerly existed. For it is certain
that, by the ch J ulia ‘de vi publica seu privata,' if a man was tried
and condemned, the injured person was not for that reason presented

from bringing his action for damages: “Hoc edicto (Vi Bonorum
