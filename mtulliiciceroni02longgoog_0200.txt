INTRODUOTION. 189

Possession was necessary to entitle a man to the beneflt ol this Inter·
dict. But his explanation of the assumed omission os these words is
very forced ; and Keller confirma his position hythe ternis ol the Inter·
dictum Uti possidetis, which contains this Exceptio, and by the older
formula in Festus (s. v. Possessio, cd. Miiller, p. 233). In the oration
Pro Tullio, ᾖ 29, there is aFormuls something different from that in
the same oration, ᾗ 44, which Keller npposes to have been the usual
form in Cicero's time. Different explanatione have been proposed ol this
diversity in the Formulae, and Keller has proposed his own (p. 308).

The other Interdict de vi, which was properly called De vi hominibus
coactis armatisve, was the Interdict in this suit between Caecina and
Aebutius. The form appears to have been this:

“Unde tu, Sex. Aebuti, aut familia aut procurator tuus A. Caecinam
aut familiam ant procuratorem illius vi hominibus coactis armatisve
dejecisti, qua de re agitur, eo restituas.’' The words ‘coactis arma·
tisve’ are cited by Cicero (0. 21), and explained.

This Interdict differed from the Quotidianum in not containing the
words ‘in hoc ann0,’ for which we bave the direct evidence of Cicero in
a letter to (l. Cassius (Ad Fam. xv. 16).

There were also omitted in this Interdict the Exceptiones‚ ‘Quum
ille possideret quod nec vi nec clam uec precario a te possideret 3’ as we
see from this oration (c. 8): ‘de vi hominibus armatis, sine ulla excep-
tione 3’ and from c. 22. 'Phe passage in the oration Pro tullio, 5 46, is
supposed by Savigny 10 refer also 10 the Interdictum Quotidianum but
it seems that he is mistaken (see Pro Tullio, § sanctes). Gaius (iv.
155) and Pomponius (Dig. tulela) prove that in their time this
Exceptio did not appear in the Interdictum de vi armata: “Sed si vi
armata dejectus es, sicut ipsum fundum recipis, etiam si vi aut clam aut
precario eum possideres, ita res quoque mobiles omnimodo recipies.”

It remains to state briefly how the law relating to the Interdictum de
vi 1111111 differed from the law relating to the Interdictum Quotidia-
nnm; the several For-mulae of the two Interdicta having been established
and stated.

In the Interdictum de vi armata it was required that the l'orce must
have been used ‘hominibus aut coactis 111 armatis‚' either one way or
the other. (See Pro Tullio, 5 7, ‘hominibus armatis coactisve') It was
immaterial whether the force consisted in actual assault cr in threats
of assanlt3 which was also the case in the Interdictum Quotidianum.
'Ibis is proved by the passages in Cicero (Pro Caecina, c. 14-17) and
numerous passages in the Digest quoted by Keller. One oi these pas·
seges will be sufficient (Dig. 43. 16. 3. ἕως “Qui armati venerunt,
etsi armis non sunt usi ad dejiciendum, si dejecerunt, armata vis lacta
