striving to raise all the world against the Romans, conclndcd an 11111111
with Mithridates, by which it was agreed thst the king should have the
provincia Asia, with Bithynia, Paphlagonia, and Galatia. This 1111
third Mithridatio war was begun no. 741 by Mithridates invading
Bithynia, which had come into tha possession 11 the Romans on the
death 11 Nicomedes III. L. Aurelius Cotta tho governor of Bithynia
fled to Chalcedon, where he was defeated hythe invader. The Greek
cities which had suffered so terribly under the Roman 11111111 11 the
taxes (publicani) and the extortion 11 the Boman money lenders, wel-
comed Mithridates as their deliverer. The king was engaged in the
siege 111111 rich and populous city of Cyzicus, when L. Licinius Lucul-
lus, to whom the command in the war had been given, arrived with five
legions and encamped close to Mithridates (1.1. 73). Η1 compelled
Mithridates to raiae the siege and to retreat precipitately, which was

the beginning 11 a course 11 brilliant successes, which continued to ἰ

In 11. (19 Lucullus again marched eastward to carry on the war in

Lucullus, but ho proved himself an ineffieient commender. Lucullus
gave up part 11 his army 1ο Glabrio (Pro Lege Manilia, c. 9),and as
neither 11 them acted with any vigour, Mithridates recovered his original
dominion 11 Pontus, and again invaded Cappadocia. Lucullus himself·

was still in Asia in command when Glabrio was superseded by On. Pom·
peius (V ell. Pat. ii. 33).

This was the state 11 affairs in Asia’ when the tribune Ο. Manilius
