THE PROVINCE ASIA.

’ Arcanos, the lasthing of Pergamum, at his death (a.c.133), left his
dominicus to the Romans, and this was the origin cf the Roman
province of Asia. The province, as constituted ao. 129, appears ιο have
comprised Mysia, cr the greater part of it, with Aeolis, Lydia, Ionia,
end Caria with the Dorian citios, with the exception of Rhodus and the
continental Peraea (Pro Flawo, c. 27). Cicero (In Verrem, ii. 1. c. 38)
assigns all Phrygia to the province ot Cilicia (nc. 80. 79). But there
were three Phrygian Dioceses which did not continue to be attached
to Cilicia During 62-56 nc. they belonged ιο Asia3 from 56-50
to Cilicia3 and aster nc. 49 they were probably permanently attached
ιο Asia. (Becker, Handbuch, Ac. Vol. iii.)

Sulla divided Asia into sorty Regiones (nc. 84) for the purpose os
fixing the assessment of the contribution ef 20,000 talents which he
imposed on the province (Plut. Sulla, c. 253 Pro Hacco,c.12). He
made forty principal towns the centres of aa many districts, and he
attached to each principal town a number ol smuller places. This divi-
sion appears to have been continued for the purpose ol the forming of
the Vectigalia of Asia (Pro Flacco, c. 37), which were let by the censors
ιο the Publicani (Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 2. c. 6). The dictator Caesar took
from the Publicani the forming of the Vectigalia af Asin, which after
the new arrangement were paid at the chief towns of each Regio by the
contributory towns. In the chief towns were kept the surveys made
for the purpose of fixing the amount cf taxes, the titlea to land, and the ·
acts of hypothecation or mortgage.

These Regiones were different from the Conventus J uridici or judicial
divisions of the province, of which ten are enumerated, and at alater
time elevon; Ephesus, the residence oi the governor, lhelles, Alabanda,
Leodicea (Jurisdictio Cibyratica), which contained twenty-five towns,
Apamea Cibotus or Celaenae, Synnada, Sardes, Smyrna, Adramyttium,
and Pergamum. We do not know if this list is complete, but it shows

us the extent oi the province of Asia, sc far aa it goes.
The province of Asia contained much fertile land and many rich

towns. The valleys of the Caicus, Hermus, Cayster aud Maeander
ι produce abundance of corn. The volcanic district oi Lydia, the Cata·
ceoaurnene, was noted for its wines. Synnada had valuable quarries.
