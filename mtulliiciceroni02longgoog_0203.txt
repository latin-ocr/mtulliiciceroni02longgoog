,1110 0011010, as Keller concludes, that Cicero’s argument (e. 32) that
00001110 was in possession, became 01 1110 Ususfructus 01 0000011010 10
worth nothing. The possession of Caesennia, whatever it 1100, did not
give 0000100 possession, simply because 110 was ‘heres' It is difficult
10 conceive how Cicero could 1001010111 such 011 argument; aud 1110
101110 01 1110 argument is not increased by what follows, which is 0
different argument altogether. He says that Caecina entered on 1110
land after Caesennia’s death, and received from the tenant the reohouings
or accounts 01 1110 farm: he received rent or what was equivalent to it.
Savigny's explanation of this 1001 110 rejected. He supposes that
00001110 trausacted this business solely with reference to past time, and
with reference to the-letting of Caesennia, aud that 110 00111011 1110
accounts between the testatrir and the colonus. This may be so, or it
may not. All that Cicero says is that he entered 001110 land 0011
received some accounts from the tenant. 0100 supposed that these
10010 show that Caecina took possession; and he is so 101 right as this:
he may have talren possession, and Cicero’s words may mean 11101 he did
take possession. But they may mean what Savigny supposes. The
conclusion is; we do not know whether ancina had taken possession 01
001. 'Phe matter is not worth further discussion, for it cannot be
determined.

Cicero’s next argument 10 111010 00001000 possessionis 1110 ‘denun-

, 010110’ 01 Aebutius (0. 7. 32). 010010101011101Αο111111110 gare some

notice to 00001110 about the land in question; from which notice, what-
escrit was, he wishes us to conclude that 0000100 was in possession 01
it. Keller shows that ‘denunciatio’ 10010110 applicable 10 notice of
various kinds; which is true, and thus no certain conclusion about
possession 000 be derived from Cicero’s words that Aebutius gave notice
to 0000100.

The 1001 argument for Caecina’s possession (c. 32) is this: Why did
Caecina propose that there should be the ‘moribus deductio,’ if hewse
not inpossession? Cicero 10110 us that 0000100 proposed this on the
advice of his friends (0. 7) 0011 0100 on the advice of Aquilius (0. 32).
It 0100 appears that he was going to the land in order 10 be formally
turned out, and that Aebutius was already on the land, if not in posses·
sion in the legal sense, at least in the ordinary sense. This does not
prove that Aebutius was in possession 01 that Caecina was not; but if
Caecina was 10 possession, why was it agreed that he should be formally

. ejected (moribus deduceretur), and so 10110 the place of plaintiff 1 For

he ‘qui deduxit ’ must be considered in possession; and ‘is qui deduc·

In the case 01 Tullius (c. 20), Fabius proposed 11101 110 should either
