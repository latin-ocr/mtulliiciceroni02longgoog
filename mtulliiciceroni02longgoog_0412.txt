INTRODUOTION. 403

The second and third orations were delivered before the people.
After the second oration Rullus addressed the people in the absence of
Cicero, who replies ιο him in the third oration.

These orations are very instructive. I might have mede the notes
more complete, but as notes are only wanted ιο explain the text, the
commentator must keep to his business and not bury the author under
rubbish, that homey have the satisfaction ol seeing how large a pile he
canbeap up. Perhaps I may be thought to have done a little ol* this
work here end there; while Iwas supposingthat I could gire the student

asew ideas on Romen history. Βο barren, disgusting‚ and tedious has ’

Roman history become in the way in which it has been hmrdled, so
fruitless in all instruction, so bewildered and so bewildering with conjec-
tures, theorice, and learning, as itis called, that one despairs oi any good
being got out of it, till people oen learn to be more modest, to believe
that an ancient historiam had some sense and some knowledge of what
he was writing about, and that more is to be learned hom Roman bis-
tory, as itis told ιο us, undoubtedly osten far from the heth, than by
the refined and subtle‚ but osten most absurd, doubts and speculatione
of modern writers.

Ihave compared the text with the text of the edition of the three
orations against Rullus in J. G. Baiter’s edition, which forms apert of
the second edition ol Orelli’s Cicero. The abbreviatione which be uasa
