390 INTRODUOTION.

or ill-managed by his family, and his little property was encroached
on by his poverful neighbours (Appias, B. O. i. 7-93 Plutarch, ri.
Gracchus, 8, 9; Florus, iii. 133 Livy, sp. 58 ; Sadluat, J og. 41). Itis
impossible that a body of small cultivators can ever exist by the aide of
meu of large estates, when the large estates are cultivated by slaves.
Whatever may be th'e disadvantages of small farma, when we consider
them purely with reference to productiora, the possession of land in
small allotments encourages marriage and the procreation oi childrsn3
aud the productior of men to supply the consumptiou of her eternal
wara was necessary for tho existence of Rome. Such was the state οἰ
Italy when Tiberius Gracchus attempted a reform or rather a revolution
which shoola Rome to its foundation, and eost him and his brother their

lives. For no man can with impuuity touch the intereatsofwowerful l

class. If he cannot completely humble it, he will perish in the attempt.
There are contests in which a man should not engage, except he has the
power and the will to destroy his enemy.

Italy groaned under miaery from the time that Rome began her con-
quests; and the Romans themselves had their share of the suffering.
We read in Livy continually ot' the cruelty and avarice oi the noble cre·
ditor ; of the sufferings of the plebeiam or poor debtor. As Rome was
au agricultural and not a commercial community, it is difficult to under·
stand how this state oi affairs arose and continued. We know that in
no country is there mors debt than in those where the property in land
is much subdivided, and where the people are eager to acquire the
ownership of land. It is au expensive thing to hold lsnd; it 'us one of
tho luxuries of the rich. Small ownera who have little capital must
often borrow, and they have no security to give except their land. lf
the poor wish to buy orto add to their small estate, they must horrow,
and hero also the land is the security. We have no evidence that the
debts of the Roman plebs originated in borrowing, and it is not pro·
buble that they did; for horrowers imply lenders, aud lendcrs urs
monied men, merchants, dealers in money, saving ahoplreepers, a class of
persons not numerous so iar as we know in the early periods of Roman
history. Besides this, commerce and money-making were not Patrician
employmcnts. The wealth of the Patrioisn, such as it was, came in
some way directly from the produce of land.

· A solution ol this difficulty has been lately offered ⁴, which Isceept
as true in substance, but not inform. Itis this :··“ The constant his·
torical connexion of agrarian lsws with lsvvs of debt, shows that we must
consider the two in connexion with ons another. The fact ia this: that
