INTRODUOTION. 475

rather a rcfiued rien of the matterr but still it seems that the name of
Perduellis was not giren to an ‘ordinary murderer, a Sicanias, but to a
man who had killed a Magistratus, or some citizen with whom he was ’
in the intimate relationship of consanguinity‚ affinity, or the relation-
ship of patron or client. The relationship might he ao near as to melre
the offeuce Parricidium.

rho form ol trial and the punishment in the case ol the· Horatius
were the same as in later times. Under the Kings‚ the King summoned
the Populua3 in the time of the Republic, a Magistratus ol the proper
rank summoned the Populus to choose tuo men (Duumriri) to hear aud
deeide; the rules ol the trial were these (Livy, i. 26): “Duumviri
perduellionem judicent; si a duumviris provocarit, provocatione certat03
si vincent, caput obnubito: infelici arbori reste (reste) suspendite:
verberato rel intra pomoerium rel extr-s pomoerium.” Il the man
was condemned, he could appeal to the popular assemhly; and if the
assembly confirmed the judgment, he rrae executed. ’

Ι Under the Republic it is supposed that the notion ol Perduellio must
have been somewhat modified. elevassemus which came within the
denomination of Perduellio are carefully collected and arranged hy
Boin (Das Criminalrecht der Rhmer, p. 474). The essence of all these
acts consiste in some form ol attach on the sorereignty of the states
among which were included attacks on the dignity and authority of the
Magistratus, especially the sacrosanot tribuniplebis. This was the
offence that Rabirius was charged with. The punishment war death by
hanging, or by being thrown from the Tarpeisn rooh (Livy, ri. 20), or ’
1)] being beheaded, which last punishment was particularly appropriated
to traitors (Livy, m 1. 20).

The appeal in case ol' Perduellio properly belonged tc the Comitia
Centuriata3 bulthe Comitia Tributa also sometimes exeroiaed jurisdic-‚
tion in such essee. Itis not our business to inquire here rrherein the
jurisdictiou of the two Comitia differed, as it is ol no importunes lor the
understanding of this oration. The matter is discussed end references
to the ancient aud modern authorities are given in Rein’s Criminalrecht
der Bdmer. Rein gives a list of cases of Perduellio brought before the
Comitia centuriata, and of cases brought before the Trihuta up to the
year nc. 107. Offences against the State as such were gradually eom·
prehendod under the term of‘ Majestas imminuta,’ which simply signi·
fies that the offender by his aot had impeired or tried to impair the in-
tegrity of the Roman State. 'l'hc striet and serere old process of Per·
duellio was dislilred, and almost went out of fashion‚ though it still
existed after the offenoe ol Majestas had been defined by several Leges.

“ The lirst Ler on Majestas was the Apuleia, proposed by the turbulent

tribune L. Apuleius Saturninus, whom Ο. Rabirius was charged with
