246 DE IMPERIO GN. POMPEII.

Q. Metellus had been sent as Proconsul (ne. 68). But Metellus per·
sisted in his design of subduing the island, which he accomplished, and
thereby obtained the cognomen of Creticus. Pompeius was still in the
, East (no. 66), when the tribune Ο. Manilius, to the great disgust of
the uobility, proposed a Lex which was to confer on Pompeius the
command in the Mithridatio War.

(¹) Mithridates VI. Eupator succeeded his father about no. 120, aud
soon began to attempt to extend his dominicas. After the defeat of
Aristonicus (ae. 129) the Romans had been firmly settled iu that part
of the peninsula between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, which
they named Asia; and Mithridates formed the design of driving them
out and seizing all the country. He had quarrelled with Nicomedes II.
about the possession of Cappadocia, and both Mithridates and Nico·
medes had addressed themselves to the Roman Senate to support their
claims. The Senate settled the disputo by taking Cappadocia from
Mithridates, which he had got possession of by murdering king
Ariarathes3 and they took Paphlagonia from Nicomedes, who had got
that country also by wrongful means. Both the Paphlagonians and the
Cappadociam were declared free people by the Romans3 but the Cap·
padocians refused the offer, upon which Ir. Sulla gave them a king,
Ariobarzanes, nc. 92. Mithridates now fonnedanalliancewith Tigranes,
king of Armenia, to whom he gave his daughter in marriage. Tigranes

athis instigation drove out the new king of Cappadocia, who fled for

refuge to Rome.
On the death of Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, rao. 91, his son aud

successor Nicomedes was expelled from the kingdom by Mithri·
dates. Nicomedes applied to the Romans for help, who commissioned
Μ’. Aquilius and L. Cassius (Appian, Mithrid. ll), the governor of the
province Asia, to restore both Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes. 'Phe
Roman commissionem restored the two kings, and persuaded them to
invade the dominions of Mithridates by promising them help from the
Romans. Nicomedes unwisely followed the advice of the commis-
sionem, and carried his ravages into the kingdom of Mithridates as far
as Amastris (Amasra) on the coast of the Euxine. Mithridates upon
this again expelled the unlucky king Ariobarzanes from Cappadocia3
and the Roman commandere without waiting for the orders of the
Senate began a campaign against Mithridates (ac. 88). This was the
beginning of the war between the king of Pontus and the Romans,
which lasted twenty-six years, being ended in ne. 63 by the death of
Mithridates. Cicero in this oration (e. 3), delivered in nc. 66, speaks
of that being the twenty-third year of Mithridates’ reign.
