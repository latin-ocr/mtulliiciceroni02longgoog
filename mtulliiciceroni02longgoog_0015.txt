4 INTRODUOTION.

pursuaut to the order of the Praetor Burrienus. The action thus turned
011 the fact of possession or no possession3 aud P. Quintius, who
affirmed that there was no possession, would bring his action for the
sum of money mentioned in the Sponsio; aud if he proved that his
goods had not been possessed in the manner aforesaid, he wouldgnin his
cause.

Cicero complains of this order as being most uujust, a question with
which the J udex had nothing at all to do. He hsd only to investigate
the matter before him according to the Praetor’s instructions. Cicero
also complains that he had to speak first; that he had to prove his ease.
He had in fact to maintaina negative proposition, as he tells us (c. 10:
‘nego fuisse caussam,' ec). Now itis generally the easieraud better way
of settling a question to prove a feet than to disprove it. If the expla-
nation of the Sponsio is right, P. Quintius must however prove his case,
for in the Sponsio Naevius had promised to pay P. Quintius scertain
sum of money if the property had not been possessed in the manner
aforesaid ; aud if P. Quintius claimed the money, he must be the plaintiff,
and he must prove his case. It is true that P. Quintius might not
choose to claim the money, but then he must admit that his property
had been possessed in manner aforesaid, and he must give the mourity
‘judicatum solvi,’ which he had refused, and refused on the guund that
his property had not been possessed. But it may be said, Why did not
· the Praetor compel Naevius to prove that the property of P. Quintius
had been possessed, and to make the same Sponsio which he compelled
P. Quintius to make? {vhe answer perhaps is, though we do not expect
Cicero to furnish us with it direetly, that the presumption was in favour
of the possession, or inother words, the fact of possession was mnsidered
so clear that nothing but some informality or irregularity iu the posses-
sion could disprove it. Cicero’s defence shows this, or why should he
try to prove thnt Naevius had no ground for ashing the Praetor's per-
mission to seiae the property, in which he admits that he did ask the per·
mission; and he also admits that he did try to get it? Why should ho
try to prove that Naevius ‘ex edicto possidere non potuisse,’ if there was
no possession at all? Fiually, his proof that Naevius ‘non possedisse’
admits the fact of partial possession, but denies that it was such apos·
session as was required. Cicero admits also (senseresensere
seized a slave of P. Quintius, and that Alfenus took the slave away.
vhe fact of possession in a manner is admitted by Cicero: and socord-
ingly it was his client's business to prove that it was not the possession «
which entitled Naevius to a judgment in his favour in the Sponsi03 and
consequently did not entitle him to require of P. Quintius a secunty
‘judicatum solvi' in the principal action.
