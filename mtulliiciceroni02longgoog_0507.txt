Dixi ad id tempus quod mihi a tr. pl. praestitutum est: a vobis
peto quaesoque ut hanc meam defensionem pro amici periculo
fidelem, pro rei publicae salute consularem putetis

Seniue ad Verp. Aeo. i. 13: Cicero pro Rabirio. Etcum uni-
verso populo Romano, tum vero equestri ordini longe carissimus.

'ibe title of the Second Edition of the orations is:-“ M. Tullii
Ciceronis orationes. Ad codices ex magna parte primum sut iterum

collatos emendaverunt I. (i. Baiterus et Car. Halmius. Pars Prior. ἓ

urrici. 1854.” See p. 136 of this Vol.

This isarery excellent edition. The various readings aregircn much ’

more completely than in Orelli'e edition3 and the text is improved in

many parts. The editors have prefixed their names to tha orations l

which they hare respectivcly edited. The Verrinae arc edited by 0. A.
Jordan. It is possible that Ι may in the notes have sometimes written

Halm for Baiter, or Baiter for Halm3 but I hare stated in the Intro·

ductione the name ol the editor oleseh oration, whose text I hare used
or compared with this.
