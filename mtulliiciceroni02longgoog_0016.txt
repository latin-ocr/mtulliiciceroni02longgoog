INTRODUOTION. 5

probable, discusses 01 some length (p. 2, 100.) what the Praetor’s 100000
was as 10 110 Sponsio, what deorse he had power to make, and what
deorse he ought 10 have made. He shows most clearly that 11 0 man's
pmperty had been seiaed in due form, any person who had an action
against him was entitled to demand the security which Naevius demanded
(Pro P. Quintio, o. ὃς Gaius, iv. ᾗ 102; Ulpian, Dig. 42. 5. 33. ς 1);
001 1110 10 110 reason why the 11000010 here is expressed generally, and
N aerius¹ namsia not mentioned. ,
Ηο 0100 supposes 1101 110 Praetor could either hare determined the
question 01 possession or no possession himself, and that his decision
would have been against Quintius, which is all immaterial 10 our present
inquiry3 or that he 00011 establish a ‘praejudicium’ or preliminary
inquiry about 110 1001, and remit 110 parties 10 0 J udex, which he did.
But in order 10 give the ludex cognizanoe 01 0 case, it was necessary
that it should be reduoible to some form 01 action. Now the question
whether a man’s property had been duly seized or 001 was 001 110
subject 01 any action3 there was uo formula or form 01 001100 10 which
this question 00011 10 tried. The Romans sometimes got over diffi-
culties 01 1110 kind by 1011000 ι in 1110 0000 by another contriranoe. It
was a Roman principle that 11 0 man had ever promised payment 01 0
1010110 sum 01 money by replying ‘spondeo’ to the question ‘spondes l’
01 110 stipulator, 110 stipulator had 0 right 01 action against him on this
simple promise. All that was necessary then was 100 110 Praetor to
require the parties to go through this form, and then the J udex could
try the question on tha Sponsio. The Sponsio was conditional: the
result of this trial depended 00110 1001 01 possession. Thefaot 01110
11000010 was 0001010. The 100101 110 possession or no possession was
to be proved ; and according 10 110 evidence the J udex would give judg·
mentior the plaintiff or 110 defendant directly on the sum 01 money,
indireotly on 110 fact 01 possession or no possession. This was 001 0
case for 0 mutual Sponsio, and for a restipulatio (V ol. i. p. 172),
because 110 object was netto malie either one or the other party pay a
sum 01 money (Sponsio poenalis), but simply to decide another 1001. If
P. Quintius proved his case, Naevius paid him nothing, but he had no
claim to the seourity ‘judicatum solvi,’ which he had required 01
Quintius (Gaius, iv. ᾖ 93, 94). 1110001000100111101101110110101 ’
Sponsio the sum 01 money in the Sponsio was 10010110 0110010100, if
judgment was iu his favour3 but the sum was merely nominal, and
probably was never paid or demanded. The question 01110 ‘sponsiones
poenales’ is also 110000001 by Keller; but it does not concern the
present matter. rho question 10 also somewhat obscure3 auditis

doubtful if wo understand 11 fully.
