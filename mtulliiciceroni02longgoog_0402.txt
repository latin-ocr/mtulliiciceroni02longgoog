- and Benedici· mining the populetion ot⁴ Italy, hsd to recruit her
srmies from ull parts oi her empire.

The lsying s ‘vectigal’ on the Possessiones was merelyc triclr to
gain time. Another tribune soon brought forword o Lex by which this
‘vectigal’ wss repecled, und so ssys Appisn (Β. 0. i. 27), “ the common
folk wss ejected ins body out of every thing; whence the State wss
more then ever in want both of citizens ond soldiers,” dcc. Thus the
nobility were finally victorious in this contest which hed lusted for cen·
truies3 their Possessioues were ssfe, snd they enlsrged their estates
until, ss we cre told, though it is hurd to believe, there were not two
thousand Romen citizens who hed any property (in lundi); thisis
whst s tribune said, L. Marcius Philippus, end Cicero reporto it (De
Off. ii. 21).

The Agrsrise Leges slter this time did not touch the Possessiones of
private persons; they were directed sgninst the property of the State,
which brought in s revenue hom rents or psyments which moy be
cslled rents. 'Phe sele of public property ior the purpose of buying
lunds for distribution among the poor wus entirely different from the
old Romen colonial principle, ss Cicero says (De Leg. Agr. ii. 27); end
smore foolish expedient could hardly be devised for cleering s grest
city like Rome of its useless population, than thot os plenting on lond
people who hed no means sor cultivating it, ond were unnsed to agricul-
tura] lnbour. It was better to seed such people at the public eost, os
they did st Rome, es they do in some greet cities now, or to nllow
them to perish by the slow but certsin desth which is s pert of their
condition. Ti. Gracchus knew thst lsnd without cepitel wss sworth·
less gift, snd he hsd proposed ‘to supply his settlers with the necessary
means out of the property which come to the Romen Stute by the tes-
tamentary giu oi the lsst king of Pergamum (Plut. ui. Grscchus. c. 14;
Livy, Epit. 58).

The tribune, M. Livius Drusus (no. 91), proposed rsrious Leges,
one of which wss to give the Civitss to the Socii und the Itnlinns. It
seems thot he also proposed to (limoso of, to sed, or to give ull thet the
State hed3 sud s ssying of his is recorded thot he hod leit nothing for
eny body to grant, unless he should choose to distribute the rnud end
tho skies (Aurel. Vict. De Vir. Ill. 66). The prospect of the Civitss
which the Lex of Livius presented to the Socii end the Itnlisns, wns the
immediate cause of the Msrsic war, sor their hopes were disappointed.
Livius himself wos ssssssinstcd, it is not known by whom; end ull his

Leges were repenled.
It is impossible to understand the history of Rome unless we clearly

comprehend thot men wes whut the Romen Stste wanted, snd not
money. Its policy was not to sid or to encourage its citizens to grow rich;
