INTRODUOTION. 249

Lex 01 Manilius, hut as tho people were 101 11, they were all afraid to
opposcit openly, except Catulus and Hortensius. Howcwcr the Lex

‚ was carried, and both O. Julius Caesar aud Cicero, then praetor (0.0. 66),

spolio iu favour 01 11. (liceto's motives may have been something 111)
what Dion Cassius imputes to him (nivi. 26), though Dion always
puts the worst construction on every mau’a acts. Cicero wished to
please the peoplc‚ and we may suppose that he thought that ho was 101-
thering his own interests by recommendiug tho on. Η) speaks 01 this
affair in the De Lege Agrar. ii. 183 where he says enough to enable us
to see what his motivas were.

This speech 01 Cicero, aa it has been well observed 1)] Halm’‚ 1)
rather an addrass 10 the Roman people for the exaltation 01 their idol
Pompeius than an argument in support 01 the Lex 01 Manilius. As a
pieoe 01 rhetoric it has 0100100111001101001011100011110001000 us his
own opinion 01 11. (Orator. 0. 29.) Fronto in ono of 1110101101) 10 Μ.
Antoninus (0.112,0(1.Ν101).) speaks aa we might expect a rhetorician
10 speah 01 11, 10 rather extravagant terma: “Mihi profecto ita videtur
'neminem umquam neque Romana neque Graecorum lingua facundius iu
contione populi laudatum quam On. Pompeius in ista 01011000 laudatus
cst, ut mihi ille videatur nou ita suis virtutibus ut Ciceronis laudibus
Magnus cognominatus.”

Halm has quoted the various MSS. authorities as 10 the title 01 this
oration, 1100) which it appears that it is named both ‘De imperio (ln. or
Gn. Pompeii‚’ ‘Pro Lego Manilia;¹ aud it has 011101 titles. Itis entitled
‘De imperio On. Pompeii' 1)] A. Gellius (i. 7), by Priscian, and by
other ancient authorities. Halm observes that, so far as he knows, it
is never entitled Pro Lege Manilia by any ancient authority.
