INTRODUGTION. 111

raptorum) 0011110 ea quae 11 committuntur consuluit Praetor; nom si
quis se 11111 passum docere possit, publico judicio de 11 potest experiri.
Neque debere publico judicio private actione praejudicari quidam pu·
tent3 sed utilius visum 001, quamvis praejudicium legi Juliae de 11
private 1101, nihilo minus tamen non esse denegandam actionem eligen-
tibus privatam persecutionem.” (Ulpian. ad Ediet. Dig. 47. 8. 2. 5 1.)

Keller 01001 establishing,as he supposes, the original For-mule founded
on the Edictum of M. Lucullus, shows bow the Edictum wes subse·
quently modified, and reduced to 1110 form in which it appears in the
Digest by the successive alterations, four in number, which have been
mentioned. He observes, 11101 condemnation in an echion founded 011
this Edictum could 1101 be ettended with Infamia before the ‘furtum’
was more considered in this matter than the ‘damnum ;’ which observo·
tionis 1101 precise, and indeed it means nothing. But 110 0110 very
truly, that the result of a ‘condemnatio' in such an action could not be
Infamia, so long as it was brought only 101 the wrongfu] act 01 0
Familia3 for Infamia could not attach 10 aman who was condemned
in any 0011011 101 the wrongful 001 01 another.

The alterations mede in the original edict were probably not made by
any ‘lex' or ‘senatus considtum,’ nor yet by the Praetors, but by the
Jurists, who laboured 01 the interpretation 01 1110 Edictum, and 00
attemptedto ndapt the Formulae 10 the circumstances and wants 01
the times ; for there 010 clear indicatione in the excerpts in the Digest
that this action ‘Vi Bonorum raptorum¹ still, contained matter 101
dispute efter the Edictum was reduced to the form in which it now
appears in the Digest.

All that we know about 1110 10010 01 this case must be collected from
the 1011 01 Cicero. Keller, who has bestowed 0 wonderful amount 01
labour on this 01011011, 00111101 determine whether Tullius or Fabius hod
judgment 111 his favour, or which 01 them ought to have had. He hes
constmcted the form 01 Cicero's speech 00 well he can from the freg-
ments3 0111 1101100 even attempted to give an outline 01 11ιο oration 11101
Quinctius made in 1010110001 Fabius. ³

Keller exemined 1110 Ambrosiam and Turin Palimpsests, end compared
his readings with those of Mai 0111 Peyron, 0111111111 1110 editions of

. Beier, Orelli, and Huschke, When he 0101111101 the 1111111 Palimpsest,
the first leaf, which contains the beginning 01 the speech, could 1101 be
found ς and it is supposed that it had been stolen.
