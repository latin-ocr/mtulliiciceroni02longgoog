we must conclude that there were salt pans in Macedonia, which the
Roman state seized, and compelled the Macedoniaus to buy this salt
only (Livy, 45. 0. 29). Just iu the same way the English deal with
salt in India (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 5. 0.18,1ιο10). The object with the
, Romans vvas the same as with the English, to get money cut 01 the
people 1)] making them pay dearer 101 salt by forbidding the importa-
ti0n; an example of injustice and greediness more culpablc in the
English than in the Romans. Phe mines in the provinces were some·
times sold to individuals3 and when they were not sold,¹money-making
men contrived by buying many slaves and getting them employed in the
mines 10 make large lor-tunes (Diodorus, v. 363 Plutarch, Crassus,
c. 2).

The provincial land which was not included in the Roman domam ·
remained in the possession 01 the occupiers. They had the use and
enjoyment (ususfructus), but the theory was that the ownership was in
the Roman State (Gaius, ii. 7). Provincial land owed apayment to the
Roman State as an evidence that what was left to the conquered people
came from the grace and marey 01 the conquerors. It was aBoman

fashiou to make people pay 101 the cost 01 being beaten, and hence after 1

the close 01 0 war they imposed money contributione on the conquered,
which were called ‘ stipendium’ because the money was applied to the
payment of the Roman troops. Heavy contributione were levied on the
conquered natione out 01 Italy, and it became a fashion tc melre these
payments permanent, the first example of which was in Illyricum (Polyb.
ii. 12). rho Romans always required these payments, as Pliny says, 10
be made in silver, and not in gold. Accordingly when the Romans
began to form Provinces out 01 Italy, they imposed ou the peoplea
money payment (stipendium), besides the obligation to supply the army
with necessarios. These Provinces were called stipendiariae, and these
Provinciales were called Stipendarii. When the Romans organized a
Provincia, which paid a Stipendium, they provided for the money being
raised by dividing the country into districts and establishing a rating
01 property like thatin the Roman census. What thellomans received
as ‘ stipendium' was contributed by the Provinciales under the name 01
‘tributum’ The notices 01 the census in the Provinces during the
’ Republican period 01 Rome are scanty, but the establishment of the
census iu the provinces is certain; and indeed the existence 01 a Stipen-
dium, which was raised by a tax on property, implies a rating or census.
Besides this, in some cases, aa in Africa, the Stipendium was raised
both by atax on property and by a poll tax, which also implies a census.
The Stipendium was collected in the several districts by the magistrates
or authorities 01 each district, who were responsible for the payment 01
the suni levied on each district. 'Phe amount 01 this tax on property
