In the year no. 63, the tr. pl. Rullus with his Lex Servilia at-
tempted 10 clear Rome of the mass of pauper citizens, as he said, by
settling them on lund (De Leg. Agr. ii. 26) ; tofree the city from apopu-
lation which was dangerous to its tranquillity. Rullus proposed 1ο con·
firm the title 10 all land that had been sold, assigned, or possessed since
the consulship of Marius and Carbo (uc. 823 De Iseg. Agr. iii. 2).
There was little public land now left in Italy, but Rullus proposed 10
distribute what still remained, the Ager Campanus and the Campus
Stellatis. He also proposed 10 sell the public property in Italy, which
was not adapted for distribution, such as the Silva Scantia, and all the
property of the State which was beyond the limite of Italy (De Leg. Agr.
ii. 15). He also proposed 10 apply the novennes derived from the new
conquests of Pompeius in the east 10 the objecta of his Lex, which
were au indemnification to' those who had been deprived of their
property by Sulla, and the purchase of lands in Italy on which the
poor of Rome were to be settled. Thelser was not carried owing to
the opposition of Cicero and the nobility; and the poor remained in

· Rome.

But Caesar did part of that which Rullus could not do. In his oon·
sulship (s. 0. 59) he carried two Leges Agrarise. Itis inferred, and
perhaps correctly, srom a passage in Dion. (mviii. 1), that the titles of
all Possessores were confirmed; but an attempt was again made to
maintein the small estates by prohibiting their alienation for twenty

κ years, a restrictiori which was removed after anser’s death by M.
Brutus and O. Cassius (Appiau, B. O. iii. 2). The Ager Campanus and
the Campus Stellatis, which Rullus had proposed to cell, were distributed
under one of Caesar's ‘leges’ among soldiers and citizens. Twenty
thousand men, who had three children or more, were selected from the
mass of poor, 'and each had an allotment (Appian, B. 0. ii. ll). Budortl'
says that Caesar indemnified the people who were turned out either
with lands or money; and he quotes Suetonius (Caesar, 38): “assig-
navit et agros, sed non continuos, ne quis possessorum expelleretur ;’‘ but
this passage has no reference to the landa of Campania. Budorff also
refers to Apphn, (B. O. ii. 94,) a passage which has nothing 10 do with
the matter. ·

The condition of the cities in the Roman Provinoes has besu briefly
explained in another place (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 6, and the notes). There were
Civitates Foederatae, and Civitates Liberae et Immunes. The Foederatae
had their condition fixed bya Foedus or treaty. The Liberae, when
they were also Immunes, paid no taxes to Rome; their land was free.
