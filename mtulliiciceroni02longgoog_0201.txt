Iu the Interdict de vi armatu, in the time of Cicero, the pleintiff was
not prejudiced, if he had obtained possession ‘vi, clem, eut precario ab
adversario 3' nor was he prejudiced if he never hed acquired (juristicnl)
possession. Ssvigny considers that this possession on the pert of the
plaintiff wns cs necessary in th'n Interdict ss in the Interdictum Quo·
tidinnum3 but his argument certainly does not establish this. (Des
Recht des Besitces‚ § 40.)

'Phe Quotidisnum Interdictum was only ‘annale' or valid within the
yeur: the other wss ‘perpetuum' not limited by uny time.

'Phe question whether Caecius hed ever got possession of the Pindus in
question or not is discussed 1)] Keller (5 4) ut greot length. Cicero mein-
tains that Csesennis ‘ possedisse' (c. 4. 7. 32); and he attempts to show
thatCsecinc‘possedisse.’ Η) sffirms that Caesennia wes in possession of
the Fundus in question, if not as her own by purchase, which he affirms
to be the fect, though he does not prove it, yet that she possessed it as
Usufructuarius under her first husbnnd’s will. Now it is certain thet
the doctrine of the Roman jurists, who are known to us, was this, thot
the Usufructuarius had no Possessio; but he had a Quasi-possessio,
which entitled him to the Interdicts il hc was ejected from his Quasi·
possessio. This is most clearly expressed in a passage ol Gaius (ii.
§93): “ usufructuariae vero usucapere non potest: primum quis non
possidet, sed habet jus utendi et fruendi.” (licere certainly does affirm
that Caesennia hed possession ol the Fundus in question3 thet if she
did not possess as owner of the property, she hed possession cs ‘usu-
fructuarius! Keller thinks that in Cicero’s time snyperson who had
the use, enjoyment of lond (uti, frui) was ssid ‘possidere ;' which
moy be sdmitted without admitting thut this was u Possessio in the
strict sense. Η) adds that Cicero repeatedly cffirms that the opposite ·
side admitted not only the fact ol Possession 1)] Caesennia, but the
‘ususfructus' ss the foundation ol this Possession. Agnin, he urges,
there is the argument in c. 32, that Caecius had a possession of the
Fundus which was e continuation os the Possessiou ol Caesennia
by means of the colonus who occupied the lsnd; und hc udds that
this would be an ubsurd argument, if Caesennia hed only a Quasi·
possessio. This is true, for Caecina claimed to hove a real Possessio.

Η) concludes that in Cicero’s time this ‘juris quusi possessio’ did not
exist either in ides or in neme, und that this Possessio wns not distin-
guished from the ‘corporis possessio? But this does not remove the
difficulty. Lot it 1)) admitted thet Cicero could properly suy thet Cec-
sennis hsd Possessio as Usufructsurius, still it is equnlly true thet the
