42 ORAT. PRO P. QUINTIO

viderimus, quum dixerint. Unum hmen hoc cogitent, ite ee graves
esse ut, si veritatem volent retinere, gravitatem possint obtinere:

neque eorum tarn temerarium quemquam fuisse, neque te ipsum id
quod turpissime suscepisses perseverare ct transigere potuisse.

daret: et eum judicio tuo comprobabas, quem spoliatum lama for·
