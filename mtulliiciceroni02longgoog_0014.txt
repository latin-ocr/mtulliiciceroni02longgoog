‘saltus’ from which he was ejected, and that all these slaves were not
ejected, though their master was. It is a thing past all understanding
how Naevius, who was at Rome, contr-ised ιο eject P. Quintius out of
the land by means of the slaves which were their partnership property,
and why P. Quintius could not keep in, when some of his slaves did.
P. Quintius appcaled to the governor of the Gallia Provincia, C. Flaccus,
who did something, as Cicero says, buthe has not toldus what it was
that Flaccus did (c. 7).

Alfenus, in the mean time, was carrying on the war with Naevius at
Bome; and as Alfenus had declared himself the representative (pro-
curator) of P. Quintius, Naevius required him to give security for the
mtissaction of the jndgment, ifit should be against P. Quintius. (See
Gaius, iv. 84, “Procurator vero‚’' dc.) Alfenus refused, because his
principal, if he were present, would not bc obliged to give this security;
and Alfenus was probably wrong in law. Por on appealiug to the
Court of the Pribuni (Cicero has forgot to tell us against what ιο
appealed, for he has not yet mentioned the Praetor’s order), he got time,
and nothing else: he was required to promise ιο produce P. Quintius
on the ides of September.

Accordingly P. Quintius came and made bis appearance3 atter which
Naevius did nothing for eighteen months, as Cicero says, though Naevius
was the claimant. At last Naevius comes before the Praetor Urbanus
Cn. Dolabella, with P. Quintius, and requires P. Quintius to give him
the security which he had asked of Alienus. of course he was going ιο
bring an action of some kind against P. Quintius, or be would not have
osked for security to ιο given ior the satisfactiones the judgment, if it
should ιο against P. Quintius. Cicero has not told us what ιιο action
was. It was either sn action ou the partnership account (pro socio), or
it was a demand of some definita sum. Naevius claimed the securhy
‘judicatum solvi,’ because he affirmed that he had been in possession of
the property of P. Quintius for thirty days, and pursuant to the edict.
P. Quintius made no objection to the form of action, but he said that
he was not bound to give the security, became his property bad not
been possessed in the way that Naevius alleged

This question then was to be settled before the action oorssd be oom-
meneed; and the cause is ‘praejudicialis,’ or one in which another thing
must be determined before the main matter can be tried.

Accordingly the Praetor decided that there must ιο a Sponsio, the
formos which is given by Cicero (c. 8, 27); and the understanding of
this oration depends on the right reading in these two chapters. Phe
formos the Sponsio is this: P. Quintius stipulates from Naevius that
Naevius must pay him a certain sum of money, ii the property of P.
Quintius bad not been in the possessiones Naevius for thirty days,
