PREFACE.

I nnvn little to say about this seeond volume 01 Oioero's orations.
It would huve appeared sooner, 11 my lnbours hed not been often
interrupted. But interruptione heve not been the only cause 01
delsy. The difficulties in some 01 these orations erese many und
00 great, that ulter all thet has been done by many excellent eom·
mentetors, there still remeius s great deel to do. I heve done the
’ best thet I eould, but I have not nlwsys been oble to sntisfy
myself3 snd though Ihsve very freely remerhed on the mistskes
ol' othere, I do not suppose thet my own work· is inultleee. How-
ever, the render will find here e great deal thet he will find in no
other edition; end he will leern thet the etudy 01 Oieero's orations
must be e severe lnbour to those who would mehe it profitable.

I hnve mentioned in the Introductions to the several orations the
editione end books which I hnve used, in order to mehe'n due
sohnowledgment to all those from whom I heve got help, and to
inform the reeder where he may look himself, 11 he ehooeee.

1 did not receive the volume 01 the new edition 01 Orelli's cicero,
which oonteins the Oratione, until Ihed finished end printed the
notes ss ser es the Oratio Pro M. Tullio ¹.
