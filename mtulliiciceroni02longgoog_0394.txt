, without trouble. 'Phe men on the waste lands, the‘clientes,’ or what-
ever they were, would cultivate portione aa a matter of course, and
build huta3 and they would begin to look on what they improved as
their own in a manner, and think that they had as good right tc hold it
against their masters, as their masters thought they bad to hold their
possessione against the state. In the writings of tbe Agrimensores
(Hyginus, De Condic. Agr. pp. 115, 138, ed. Lech), we lind it distinctly

stated that each man occupied of thie public land just what he bled, and
often took more than he could cultivate, as a man certainly would do,
and in the hope that he should cultivate it sometime.

This Possessio cf the Ager Publicus is mentioued as a privilege of
the Patres, of the class os nobles, as opposed to another class named
the Plebs. The statement of Livy is very precise, and indeed all that
he says about the Ager Publicus is perfectly clear. Those who refuso
to accept the statements of aRoman writer, who could not be igno·
rant about a matter which had agitated Rome for centuries, cannot
complain if we refuse to accept their guesses about a thing of which
they hnow nothing except what they leam from the ancient writers
themselves. Livy (iv. 48) says of the tribuni pl. Sp. Maecilius and
Metilius, “that they promulgated aRogatio sor dividing the land taken
from the enemy in share· among the people, and that the effect of this
Plebiscitum was to declare the fortunes of a large part of the nobles to
be public property, forthere was scarcely any land that had not been
won by the swerd, which was naturally the case witha city that had
been planted on a foreign soil, nor did any except plebeians hold land
which had been sold or assigned hythe state.’' Phe ‘nobiles’ got land
on better terme than the Plebs, except when an assignment was made;
and the assignments were only small allotments such as a noble would
not care to have, even if be might have them. He got the use of large
tracts on easicr terme. The historical value of Dionysius’ testimony
may not be considered very great, but be, lilae Livy, supposed that a
largo part os the land which the Romans acquired by conquest was occu·
pied by men who neither bought it nor received it by assignment. It
was alleged by those whom be represents as complaining that they got
nothing (Antiq. Rom. x. 87), that these men had no title to the land,
an assertiou which is by no means inconsistent with the sect of those
who had the land maintaining that they bad a title to the use of it.
The Possessores with the aid of their cliente resisted the enactment of a
Lex Agraria (x. 40, 41), from which we infer that the clienta of the
nobles bad an interest in opposing such a Lex, and that they were
planted on these lands by their Patroni, who could indeed make no use
ol their lands if they had not had men to put upon them.

Phe nobles must have had ‘ager privatus‘ within the old limite of the
