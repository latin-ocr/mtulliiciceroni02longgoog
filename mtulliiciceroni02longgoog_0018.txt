account, or on any other account (a 11-14); and secondly by showing
that Quintius had not failed in making any appearance which be was
bound ιο mahe(c.15-18). Keller has snswercd Gioero's arguments
in support of these two positions, in which I do not think it necessary
to follow him. Ido not dissent from all that he says, nor from much of

it. The weahncseof Cicero’s argument is proper matter for the student
to eremias himself on.

The second division (c. 19 -27) contains the arguments which show ⁶

that Naevius couhl not have seized the property of Quintius ‘en edicto?
This part of the defence is subdivided into five parts. In the first part
(c. 19-22), ιιι cases are considered in which a man’s property may be
seizcd by bis creditors3 and tha case of Quintius is not any of these.
Ιιι ιιι second part it is urgedf(c. 23, 24) that if the goods had been
seised, the rest of the creditore of Quintius would have put in their
claime, and the goods would bave been sold. As this was not done,
Cicero concludes that Naevius had not possession ‘ex edicto ;’ mani·
festly an illogical conclusion. In the third he affirma that when tha
dictator L. Sulla was selling some property of the proscribed Alfenus,
Naevius was a purchaser, and said that the purchase was on the joint
account of P. Quintius and himself; whence he concludes that the
goods of Quintius were not seieed, for Naevius would not have medea
joint purchase with a man who was in the ignominious condition of a
debtor with his goods seized. This is very feeble: the facts are imper-
fectly stated, and it is impossible to accept the argument as worth any
thing, with such knowledge of the facts ss we have. In the fourth,
Oioero attempta to show that Naevius sent men to Gallia to tuhe posses-
sion before be got ιιι Praetor's permission3 aud he proves this by the
'tima And in the fifth place, Naevius did not take possession ‘ex
edicto,’ even if the fact of possession is admitted, because be turned
Quintius out of ιιι lund in Gallia byforce (c. 27).

Keller examines all thess heads of argument. He does not admit
that (licero’s argumentis worth any thing, even if we suppose it to be
truc that Naevius sent men into Gellia to seiae the land before he got
the Praetor's order. He thinks this scisura, which might be a prudent
measure, justified by an order obtained afterwards. Idon't suppose
that any body will agree with him here; nor when he says on tha fifth
head, that if Naevius took possession of the property in Gallia in a
manner contrary to the order of the Praetor, he still bad possession ‘ex
edicto? Klots, he says, is of the same mind with himself. Something
more is said of this in the notes.

The third division contained the proofs and arguments that Naevius
had notin fact seised the property of P. Quintius ; but unfortunately all
this division which came between c. 27 and c. 28 is lost, and wecan only
conjecture what was its purport from the peroration (c. 29, dc).
