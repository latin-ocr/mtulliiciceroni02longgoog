PRO SEX. ROSCIO AMERINO
enarre.

.——-——-

INTRODUO'HON.

Tan facts ql. this case are stated clearly in the oration. It is a-speech “

of Cicero, his first in aPublica Caussa, in defence of Sex, Roscius Ameri-

nus, who was tried for the murder of his father. It does not appear .

[rom this speech what the evidence was against S. Roscius, the son, or
that there was any evidence ; for Cicero does not argue against any
evidence. He says in one passage that the evidence had not been
heard. But it is a defence, and a reply to Erucius, who was the accu-
sator of S. Roscius, at tha instigationes Chrysogonus, as we are told.
Erucius then had opened the case with a statement of the charge against
Roscius, and somematters, we must suppose, that he would try to prove
in support of the charge.

Plutarch’s story is (Cicero, c. 8) that Chrysogonus laid an infoma·
tion about the property of S. Roscius, the sathanas being one of thc
proscribed, and that the property being accordingly sold, he bought it
for a small sum. He adds: ‘⁶ Roscius, the aon and heir of the dead
man, complained of this, and shewed that the property was of the value
of two hundred and fifty talenta, on which Sulla being convicted, was
augry, and with tha assistance of Chrysogonus instituted a prosecution
against Roscius for parricide.’' This is not eractly Cicero's story, but it
may contain some truth. Cicero could not ventura to affirm that Sulla
was privy to all the villainy of which he speaks. Plutarch says that
Roscius was acquitted·, which we might infer from a passage of Cicero
(Brutus c. 90); and in another passage he distinctly affirms it (De Off.
ii. 14). He has himselfin his Orator (c. 30) passed ajudgment on this

juvenile production. It appears that Cicero left itas he wrote it, ὴ

though it was his fashion to work up and improve his speeches. He

was stillayoung man when he made this speech, fresh from the rheto- ἵ

rieul schools, and twenty-seven years of age, as Gellius shows (xv. 28),
