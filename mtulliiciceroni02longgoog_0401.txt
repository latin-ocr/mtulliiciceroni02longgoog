392 INTRODUOTION.

Possessores shows that Gracchus was honest; but 10 made a mistalre 11
he thought that he could satisfy the rich by this concession. The land
thus resumed and all the Ager Publicus which was let, except some
parts 01 110 Ager Publicus, were to be distributed among those who had
no land, but it was charged vvith a payment, an annual payment‚ we may
assume (Plut. O. Gracchus, 0. 9). 11 was a provision 01 1110 Lex that
the grantees 01 1110 public land were not allowed to 0011 11010 allotments
(apprehensione. This provision shows clearly, as we might
infer even without it, that the owners 01 small allotments often sold
their land from necessity, and thus the large estates became still larger.

But to give a poor man a piece 01 land and not to allow him to scil it‚is χ

only a step more absurd than the giving 01 landto 0 man who has no
' means 01 cultivating it. The Lex 01 Gracchus touched the Italian
allies 01 Rome as wellas the citizens, for many 01 110 11011000 had got
possession of public land (Appian, B. C. i. 21. 343 Valer. Max. ix. 5.1) ;

and accordingly the consul Fulvius Flaccus (0.0. 125) proposed to ,

give these Italicus the Roman Civitas as an indemnification for the land

that they would lose (Appiam B. 0. i. 21. 34). But as only few 01110 ³

Italians compared with the whole number would be Poasessores, this
was the same 00 proposing to give the Civitas 10 01111 afew were willing
to pay for it by giving up their Possessiones. However‚ whether this
story be true 0010100, 1110 said that the Senate rejected the proposal 01
Flaccus. 1108000100100 successfully resisted Ο. Gracchus in his at·
tcmpts 10 prosecute his brother’s reforma (0.0. 123). Alter 110
murder 01 0. Gracchus, a Lex was enacted which empowered the owner
01 assigned land to aell it (Appian, B. 0. i. 27) ; and “ immediately the
rich bought 01 110 poor, or 00 11000 pretexts drove them from their
lands3 and things became even worse 100110 poor, until Spurius Borius,
0 ‘tribunus plebis‚’ proposed aLex, that the (public) land should 00
longer be assigned, but that it should be the property 01 those who held
it, who were to payto the State a‘vectigal’ (φόρους), 110 produce ol
which was 10 10100 distribution. This was indeed some comfort to the
poor by reason 01 110 distribution 01 110 produce 01 this ‘vectigal 3‘ but
it was 01 no 000 100 helping population.'' The encouragement 01 pro·
creation should not be overlooked, when we are considering the Agm-
rian lawa. Obildren may be procreatcd by the poorest and most
miserable 01 mankind, but they can only be raised by those who have
proper means 01 subsistence. We do not know what was the annual
consumption 01 men in the Roman armies at this time; but we know
that the armies were recruited with difficulty. The consumption 01 men
in war may be so grem thata sufficient supply ean scarcely be got after
leaving men enoughto tillthe fields andto do other necessary work. Italy
was now filled with slaves, the old Italian cultivator was disappearing,
