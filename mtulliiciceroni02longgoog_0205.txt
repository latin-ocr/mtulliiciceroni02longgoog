194 PRO A. OAEOINA.

‘stipulatio' which after the fashion of the old Legis aetio was called ‘pro
praede litis et vindiciarum' (Gaius iv. 93, 94). In these two forms we
observa that the Sponsio corresponded to the Sacramentum, and that
there was a resemblance in the security (satisdatio).

But what hemme of the ‘manuum consertio,’ or ths claim ol each
party made by the manual apprehension, and oi the ‘vindiciae' which
was fixed by the Praetor?

In order to simph'fy the proceedings before the Praetor, the manual
apprehension and the possession were lest to be settled by the parties
themselves3 and ss the mode ei doing this was established by usage, it
was called ‘moribus deductio? For what, says Keller, was the effect
oi theold ‘manuum consertio’ (Pru Murena, a 12), and the declaring
of the ‘vindiciae‘ or possession by the Praetor? It was plainly thisz
both parties claimed the ownership of the thing, but by this proeseding
it was settled thet during the suit one oi the perdes should be in pos·
session and should be the defendant, the other was to be the plaintiff.

Upon the abolition oi the Legis actiones, the mare thing was weom-
plisbed by the Deductis. Accordingly he who was not in possession
made a show oi au attempt to enter and take possession, while his oppo-
nent made a show of resistance, and ss it were ‘deducebat’ or put die
other off the land. Yet to show thet this was merely a form, he pro- “
miced to defend his title (vadimonium promittebat) against the man
who had attempted to enter, and thiu became the defendant in the
aetion.

Accordingly Keller supposes that this Deductis was a prelirninary to
the In rem actio, whenever there wasa disputo about the ownership,
but no disputo about the present possession. As he ‘qui deduci se
passm est' was the plaintiff, and he ‘qui deducebat’ was in possession
sud th'e defendant, it is plain that when both parties claimed to be in
possession neither would consent ‘deduci’ and either would consent
‘deduem' In this osse the proeeedingwss hythe Interdictum Uti
possidetis.

As to Cicero's argument then thet Caecina, unless hs had been in
possession, would not hare proposed that he should ba formally ejected
by Aebutius, Keller concludes that this very proposition is an argu-
ment that Caecina, so far from being in possession, hed st the time of

the agreement about the Deductis admitted that Aebutius was in pos-
session. Keller attempta to explain (p. 372) how Cicero might use
such s false argument, and yet have some show of reason in it.
IiKeller's viesm are correct neither the Deductis, nor the Denun-
oistio, nor th'e Ususfructus aad letting of Caesennia shows that Caecina
was in possession. This is also the opinion of flavigny (Besita, 5 ).
