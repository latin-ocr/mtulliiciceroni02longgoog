110 PRO Q. ROSOIO COMOEDO.

at 0 proper time and place, and when it is usual ior people to melre
such entries in their books, it is very easy 00 conceive this entry as the
thing on which the creditor sues; though it is equally plain that he
must prove the existence of the debt. Tho absence of cuchen entry
might in some casas be ground for presuming 000000 debt existed, if 0
demand were made; and if evidence of the debt were given, the omission
ol the entry might be some ground of presumption against the truth of
the evidence.

The fourth class of ‘obligationes’ is those ‘consensu' which are
buying and selling, letting 000 hiring, partnership and mandatum
(Gaius iii.135). They were called ‘obligationes consensu,’ because no
particular form of agreement was required. It was sufficient lor the
parties to have agreed, and οο have expressed their agreement in any
form which would shew their intention.

Unterholzneria a good deal puzzled 00000 this entry in the books3
he cannot understand how the debtor could be bound by the creditor's
act. But his essay was written before the Ma. of Gaius was discovered.

flavigny in his essay 00 000 literal contract and in the appendix
(1849) 00 his original esaay (p. 236), has smnmcd up this matter very
clearly, thus:

“ The old literal contract was made complete 00 0 formal 0000000000,
000 by an independent instrument, which had reference to this single
0000000οἱ00, 000 by the entry of a debt into the ledgcr; and it was
certainly the entry by the creditor (‘axpensilatio’)‚ which made the
essence of the transaction, and gave tc it its name; not the entry by
the debtor (‘ acceptilatio ³), which corresponded to the other.

“ The legal 0000000οἱ00 which thus originated, stood 00 the same line
witha loan of money 000 0 ‘stipulatio’ since, like 000 00000 two, it
established an independent ‘certi condictio! A 1000 itself certainly
appeared 0100 in the ledger as ‘expensum' but it did 000 operate as 0
literul 00000000, 000 in its original nature aa ‘re contracta obligatio:’
otherwise the lcan would hare bean absorbed by the literal contract,
and would never have appeared as an independent legal tranmction.

‘⁴ 'Phe literal contract must therefore always have another ‘mussa’ for
its foundation, which by the entry would have the same character 00 0
loan of money, since after the entry it was considered 00 ifa sum of
money had been lent to the debtor.”

'Phia is clear 000 undoubtedly true, 00 least the first 000 third para·
grapho. Whether the whole of the second is true I am not sure,

It remaina now to explain what a ‘certi condictio’ is, and then all
will have been done that can be done 00 explain the natura of the
question in this difficolt oration. nus following is in substance tho

explanationes savigny (Syrtem tc, Vol. V. 5 218, dac).
