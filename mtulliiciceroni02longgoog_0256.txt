- DE IMPERIO GN. POMPEII

INPRODUOPION.

Ο. Haau's edition of this oration (Leipzig, 1848) contains well-written
Latin Prolegomena in four chapters. In the first chapter he treats of
the acts of Pompeius before he ieoeived the command in the war against

and the opening of the aeas to commerce. (Plut. Pomp. 26.)

Pbe public expectation was not disappointed. Phe aeae were cleared
