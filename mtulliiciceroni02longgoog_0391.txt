foed his cattle and cut wood. This old institution ofbommon land, ss
it was called (compascua, communalis, pro indiviso), existed iu Italy
long alter Rome was mistress of the peninsula (hostin. de (lontr. p.
15, ed. Lachmann). If the Romans ceptsued a town and destroyed the
people, ull the land would be vacent and ready for new occupante.
When e conquered people cameto terms with the Romans, they lost a
part of their lende, generally e third, and sometimes two-thirds, or even
the whole (Livy i. 15 ; ii. 25 3· ii. 41). Itis not said how things were
settled when a town lost a part of its territory. The Romans would
not take only the pasture lande, only the hills aud wastes, which were
lit for nothing but pastmuge. They took srable laud too. When they
took all, the people must of course perish, if they were not made slaves 3
or they must seek refuge in some other place. This, which seems so
difficolt for us to understand or explain, was not so difficult to the
Greeks aud Romans, who turned people out of their lands without
troubling themselves whether they periched or not (Thucyd. ii. 27;
Dionys. Antiq. Rom. ix. 60, the ease of Antium). Even in modern war·
tere a town may be destroyed and the inhabitants compelled to seels s
home where they cau. The story about Antium, saitis told by Diony·
sius, is intelligible and probably true. The Romans wished to send settlers
to Antium, which had submitted to their arms, but the plebeisns and
the poor did not like to go. As the proper number for a Colonia could
not be found at Rome, the senate permitted Latini and Hernici to join
the Colonia. The Triumviri divided part of the lands of Antium among
the colonists aud left a pert to the Antiates (Dionys. ix. 69). The
historien then says (ix. 60), that “those Antiates who had houses and
laude stayed in the country, cultivating both what hed been set apert
for them end what had been appropriated to the ‘coloni' on certain
fixed terma and portione, which they paid to them out of the produce.
But those who had nothing went from the city, and being readily
received by the Aequi, they made excursione from ste country os the
Aequi and plundered the lands of the Latini? The &man settlers then
employed the Antiates, who were allowed to stay at home, in cultivating
the allotments made to the settlers, who received a tired share of
the produce.¹ It wee a metayer system. It seems that all the land was
parcelled out, end in some wey which is not explained a certain number
of the Antiates were selected, to whom a pert os the land vas granted.
It was better for the settlers that some of the Antiates should be lett,
for the settlers thus got their allotments cultivated without any trouble.
The Atheniens did the same with Lesbos when they parcelled out the
land among Athenien citizens, to whom the Iaesbiaus paid arent for the
use of the lund which hed once been their own. This plain statement
